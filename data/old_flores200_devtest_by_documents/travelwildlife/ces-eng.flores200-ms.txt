Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and for many tourists it is the highlight of the trip.
The term safari in the well-known sense refers to land travel to see stunning African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to the vehicles, so standard equipment allows a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can better observe them with binoculars.
A tourist safari consists of a walking tour lasting from several hours to several days.
