Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, and for many tourists it presents the highlight of the whole road.
The term Safari in the well -known sense refers to ground travel for the purpose of inspection of stunning African game, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the vehicles, allowing standard equipment to give a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can better observe them with a telescope.
The tourist safari consists of a hike lasting several hours to several days.
