Aerosmith have cancelled the remaining concerts of their tour.
The rock band was due to tour the United States and Canada until 16 September.
The tour was cancelled after lead singer Steven Tyler was injured in a fall from the stage during a performance on 5 August.
The programme started at 20.30 local time (15.00 UTC).
Celebrated singers from all over the country paid tribute to Shri Shyam's feet with bhajans or devotional songs.

Lakkha Singh then took the initiative in singing the bhajans.

Lakkha Singh also presented a bajan chhappan bhog. He was accompanied by singer Raju Khandelwal.
