Aerosmith has canceled the rest of his tour's concerts.
The rock band should have been on tour of the USA and Canada until September 16.
They canceled the tour after singer Steven Tyler fell off the stage while performing on August 5 and was injured.
The program started at 8:30 a.m. local time (15:00 UTC).
From all over the country, singers performed bhajane, or dedicated songs to the feet of Shri Shyam.
The evening was started by singer Sanju Sharma, followed by Jai Shankar Choudhary.
Then Lakkha Singh took over the singing of the Bhajans.
Baba Shyam was served 108 plates of Chhappan Bhogi (in Hinduism, 56 different foods were offered to the deity, such as sweets, fruits, nuts, dishes, etc.).
Lakkha Singh also conducted chhappan bhog bhajan. Singer Raju Khandelwal accompanied him.
