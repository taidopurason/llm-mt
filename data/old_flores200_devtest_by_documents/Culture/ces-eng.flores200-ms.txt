In 1956 Słania moved to Sweden, where three years later he started working for the Swedish Post and became its chief engraver.
He has produced more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.
The quality and details of his work are so recognized that he is one of the few "established names" among philatelists. Some people specialize only in collecting his work.
His thousandth stamp was the magnificent stamp "Great Deeds of the Swedish Kings" by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl from 2000, which is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
He has also created engravings for banknotes of many countries, with recent examples of his work being portraits of prime ministers on the front of Canada's new $5 and $100 notes.
