In 1956, Slania moved to Sweden, where three years later he started working for the Swedish Post and became their chief engraver.
He produced more than 1000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.
His work is so recognisable for its quality and detail that he is one of the few "celebrities" among philatelists. Some people concentrate on collecting only his works.
His remarkable 1000th stamp, David Kl√∂cker Ehrenstrahl's "Great Deeds of the Swedish Kings" of 2000, was included in the Guinness Book of World Records.
He has been hired by many countries to engrave banknotes, and recent examples of his work include the portraits of Prime Ministers on the front of the new Canadian $5 and $100 notes.
