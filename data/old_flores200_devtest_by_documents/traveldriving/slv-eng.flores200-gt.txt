Anyone who will drive at high altitudes or across mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperature below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is bad and you cannot drive as if you were on the bare asphalt.
Among the snowstorms, there can be enough snow in a very short time to stay trapped.
Visibility can also be limited by the snow or snow carried by the wind, or due to condensate or ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, the ice and snow conditions in many countries are something common and traffic is mostly smooth throughout the year.
