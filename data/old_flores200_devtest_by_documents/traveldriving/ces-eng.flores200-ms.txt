Anyone driving at a high altitude or a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as much as you do on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow falls in a very short time to make it impossible for you to drive.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or flying snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
Ice and snow, on the other hand, are normal in many countries and operations continue without major interruptions throughout the year.
