Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperature.
On icy and snowy roads, grip is poor and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to stay trapped.
Visibility may also be limited by snow or snow carried by the wind, or by condensate or ice on vehicle windows.
Icy and snow conditions, on the other hand, are common in many countries and traffic mostly runs smoothly throughout the year.
