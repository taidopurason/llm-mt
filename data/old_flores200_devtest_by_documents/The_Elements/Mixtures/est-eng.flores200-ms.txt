Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also such metals as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
