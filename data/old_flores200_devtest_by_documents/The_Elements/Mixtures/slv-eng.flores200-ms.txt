Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
