Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Remember, there are lots of elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are classified as metals. But of course there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
