People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as they can be found naturally in nature and are relatively easy to mine with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle hypothesized that everything is formed from one or more mixtures of four elements. These included land, water, air and fire.
It was more like the four aggregate states (in the same order) — solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma — though he also speculated that they formed the new substances we see.
