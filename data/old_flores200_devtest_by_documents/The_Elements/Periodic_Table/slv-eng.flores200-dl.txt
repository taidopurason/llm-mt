People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as all of them can be found in their original form in nature and can be mined quite easily with simple tools.

In fact, they were more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he argued that they change into new substances to form what we see.
