Humans have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, as these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be mined relatively easily using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These elements were earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances forming what we see.
