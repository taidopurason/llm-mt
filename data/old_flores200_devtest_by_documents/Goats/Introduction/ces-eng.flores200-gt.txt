The goats were probably domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes have begun to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skin.
Mostly home goats were kept in herds that wandered hills or other pastures and often guarded herdsmen, often from children or adolescents, like the more famous shepherds of sheep.These methods of grazing are still used today.
