It appears that the goats were originally domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to consider them in order to gain easy access to milk, coat, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept as herds that explored hills or other pastures, and were often grazed by goat herds of children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known flocks of sheep. These types of grazing are still used today.
