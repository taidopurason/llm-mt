It seems that the goats were originally domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to get simple access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept as herds that were renewed on hills or other pastures, and often grazed with children or teenage goat herds similar to more well -known sheep herds.These grazing methods are still used today.
