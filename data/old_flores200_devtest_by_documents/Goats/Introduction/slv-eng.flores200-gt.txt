For the first time, the goats are expected to domesticate about 10,000 years ago in Mount Zagros in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Homemade goats were mostly in herds that were wandering through the hills or other grazing areas, and they were often taken care of by goat shepherds who were often children or adolescents, much like the more well -known sheep shepherds.These ways of managing herds are still used today.
