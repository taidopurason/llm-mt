Goats are thought to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started breeding them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas and were often cared for by goat herders, who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar sheep herders. These methods of herd management are still used today.
