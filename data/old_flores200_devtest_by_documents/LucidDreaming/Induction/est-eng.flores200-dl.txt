Sleep disturbance is the process of waking on purpose during the normal sleep period and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to do if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness but does not wake you up completely.
If you find that you are turning off the alarm while you sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, so that you have to get out of bed to press it.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or a known diuretic tea) before bed to force yourself to wake up to urinate.
