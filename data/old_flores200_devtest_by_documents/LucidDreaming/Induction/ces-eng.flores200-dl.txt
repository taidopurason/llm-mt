Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up from normal sleep and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This is easily achieved by using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm from sleeping, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, which will force you out of bed in order to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, as it forces a person to get up and go to the toilet.
