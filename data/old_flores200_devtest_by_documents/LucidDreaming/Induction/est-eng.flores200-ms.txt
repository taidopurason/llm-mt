Sleep disturbance is the process of waking up purposefully during a normal period of sleep and falling asleep again after a while (10-60 minutes).
It's easy when you're using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you find that you turn off the alarm clock while you sleep, then you can place it on the other side of the room, which is why you are forced to get out of bed to press it.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea as a well-known diuretic) before going to bed to force yourself to wake up to urinate.
