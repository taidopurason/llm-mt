At the lower end of the scale are medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey, starting with hares and ending with antelopes and goats.
Lastly, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats), which eat much more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, the specific job each cat does that keeps it from competing with others.
