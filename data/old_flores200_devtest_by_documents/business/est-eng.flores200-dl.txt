Jamie Siminoff, the ring's managing director, has previously mentioned that the company started when he couldn't hear the doorbell ringing in his garage workshop.
"He built a doorbell with Wi-Fi," he said.
Siminoff said sales picked up after he took part in a 2013 episode of the show "Shark Tank" in which the show's panel of experts refused to fund the startup.
In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on the shopping channel QVC.
Ring also made a deal with a rival security company, ADT Corporation.
