Jamie Siminoff, the ring's managing director, has previously mentioned that the company started when he didn't hear the ringing of a doorbell to a workshop in the garage.
"He built a doorbell with Wi-Fi," he said.
Siminoff said sales picked up after he participated in an episode of the show "Shark Tank" in 2013, in which a panel of the show's experts refused to fund the startup.
At the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on the QVC shopping channel.
Ring also made a settlement process with a rival security firm, ADT Corporation.
