Previously, Jamie Siminoff, CEO of Ring, remarked that the company was created when he did not hear the bell in his garage workshop.
He said he made a wireless house bell.
Siminoff said sales rose after appearing on an episode of Shark Tank in 2013, where a commission refused to fund the startup on the show.
At the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on the QVC sales TV channel.
The ring also negotiated a settlement with competing security firm ADT Corporation.
