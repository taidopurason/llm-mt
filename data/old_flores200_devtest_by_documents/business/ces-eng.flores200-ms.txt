Jamie Siminoff, managing director of Ring, previously said his company was founded after he couldn't hear the sound of a doorbell in his garage.
He stated that he created a doorbell over WiFi.
Siminoff said sales increased after his appearance on the 2013 episode of Shark Tank, where the show's management refused to fund the startup.
At the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on the QVC teleshopping channel.
Ring also resolved a lawsuit against rival security firm ADT Corporation.
