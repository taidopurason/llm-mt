Of the Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza survives today.
The great pyramid built by the Egyptians in the third century BC. It is one of many larger pyramid structures built to commemorate the deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau or in the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
