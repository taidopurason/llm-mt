The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that stands to this day.
The large pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many large buildings of the pyramid shape built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
Giza Plateau, or "Gízská necropolis" in the Egyptian valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (of which the large pyramid is the largest), small tombs, temples and large sphinxes.
The Great Pyramid was created as a tribute to Pharaoh Chufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
