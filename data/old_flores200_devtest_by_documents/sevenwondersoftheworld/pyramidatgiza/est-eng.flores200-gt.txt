The Cheops pyramid is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has survived to this day.
The great pyramid built by the Egyptians in the third century BC is one of many giant pyramid structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Nekropol" in the Egyptian Dead Valley contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the largest pyramid), several small graves, several temples and a large sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khuf, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to respect Khufu women and family members.
