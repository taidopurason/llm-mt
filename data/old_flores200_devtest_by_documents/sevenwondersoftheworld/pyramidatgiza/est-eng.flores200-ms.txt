The pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has survived to this day.
The Great Pyramid, which was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many giant pyramidal structures that were built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
