In remote locations without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside, in the satellite's unobstructed line of sight, to make a phone call.
The service is often used by the shipping industry, including pleasure boats, but also by expeditions that need remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
