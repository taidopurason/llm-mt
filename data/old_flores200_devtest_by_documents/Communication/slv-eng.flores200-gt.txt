In remote places without a mobile signal, you may only be able to use a satellite phone.
The satellite phone usually cannot replace the mobile phone, as you have to be outdoors and have an unobstructed sight view so you can make a call.
This service is often used in ship transport, including excursion vessels, as well as for expeditions that require service for distant data and speech.
A local telephone service provider can provide you with more information about connecting with this service.
