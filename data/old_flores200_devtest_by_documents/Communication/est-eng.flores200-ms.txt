In remote locations without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, since to make a phone call you need to be outside, in the undisturbed field of view of the satellite.
The service is often used by shipping, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about how to connect to this service.
