The satellite phone is not generally a refund for a mobile phone, because to call, you must be outdoors without obstacles between you and the satellite.
This service is often used by shipping, including recreational vessels and expeditions that need remote data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
