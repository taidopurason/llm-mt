The tiger, a versatile athlete, is able to climb (though not well), swim, overpower, overpowering the big distances and pulling five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and Jaaguars.Only these four cats can roar.
The tiger roar is not like a lion loud roar, but rather a sentence of the words screaming.
