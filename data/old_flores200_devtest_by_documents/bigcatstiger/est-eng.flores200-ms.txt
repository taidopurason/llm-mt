The tiger, a versatile athlete, is able to climb (although not well), swim, overcome great distances by jumping and pull with five times stronger force than a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. Only these four cats can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like a lion's loud roar, but rather a sentence of lyingly screamed words.
