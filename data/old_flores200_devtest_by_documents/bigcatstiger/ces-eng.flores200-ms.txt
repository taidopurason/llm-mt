A tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times more force than a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (genus panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion at full throat, but rather like a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
