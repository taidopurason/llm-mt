The tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump over long distances and pull with five times more power than a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Genus panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguaries.These four cats are the only ones they can yell.
The tiger roar is not like the roar of a lion from a full throat, but rather as a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
