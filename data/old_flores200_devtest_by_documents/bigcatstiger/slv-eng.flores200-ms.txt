The tiger is a good athlete and can climb (though not the best), swim, skip long distances and pull five times harder than a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four representatives of large cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger roar is not as full and uniform as a lion, but more severed growling and screaming.
