A tiger is a good athlete and can climb (although not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull five times harder than a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not as full and unified as the lion's, but more of a cut-off growl and scream.
