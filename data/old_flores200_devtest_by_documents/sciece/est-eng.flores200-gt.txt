In addition to proving that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - the widespread theory - allows you to see details that are not usually seen in fossils, such as color and three -dimensional layout.
To.According to the researchers, the animal's feathers were chestnut and light or yellowish-red.
The finding allows you to look at the evolution of birds' feathers.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a feathered feather, which is called a feather, but has other feather parts - feather and feathered - the scientists concluded that the feather rods were likely to develop evolutionarily from the rest.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying, but rather to control or demonstrate temperature.The researchers suggested that an example is an example of an adult feathery, not a chick, although it is a young dinosaur tail.
Scientists assumed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the adult feather, not the chick's fog.
They discovered that the sun works on the same principles as other letters: it was discovered that the action of all the letters in the system was guided by their brightness, rotation, and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the number of star rossby associated with plasma flow.
The smaller the number of Rossby, the less active the letter is active in magnetic conversion.
The standard 802.11n operates at frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz.
This provides retroactive compatibility with standards 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided that the base station has two radios.
The speed of 802.11N is much faster than that of its predecessors: its maximum theoretical performance is 600 Mbit/s.
