As well as proving that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - already a widely accepted theory - it allows us to see details not usually seen in fossils, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to the researchers, the animal's plumage was maroon and the underside pale or yellowish-red.
The findings offer a glimpse into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have an evolved feather tuft, called a feather web, but do have other feather parts - the feather web and the feather tail's feathery base - the researchers concluded that the feather web probably evolved later than the rest of the feathers.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or demonstration. The researchers suggested that the specimen is an example of an adult feather, rather than a chick's down feathers, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur.
The researchers speculated that although this is a young dinosaur tail, the sample shows adult plumage, not chick plumage.
They discovered that the Sun works on the same principles as the other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system was found to be governed by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversal.
The 802.11n standard operates at frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz.
This allows backward compatibility with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided that the base station has two radios.
802.11n is significantly faster than its predecessors, with a maximum theoretical performance of 600 Mbps.
