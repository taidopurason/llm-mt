This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (this theory is already widespread), but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, for example a color and three -dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown top with pale or carotene -colored underside.
The discovery also provides an insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a very developed spine called Rachis, but has different features - rays and hooks - researchers have concluded that Rachis probably evolutionary evolutionary later than these other characters.
The feather structure suggests that it was not used in flight, but rather to regulate temperature or demonstration.Scientists assume that although it is a tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not a cub.
Scientists assume that although it is a tail of a young dinosaur, it is a sample of the plumage of an adult animal and not a dust feathers.
They found that the sun works on the same basic principle as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system is clearly determined by their aperture, rotation and nothing else.
Based on the luminance and rotation, Rossby's star number that is related to the plasma flow is determined.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star in terms of magnetic turnover.
Standard 802.11n operates at 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz frequencies.
Thus, backward compatibility with standards 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g will be possible, provided the base has a dual transmitter.
The speeds of 802.11n are significantly higher than in its predecessors with a maximum theoretical permeability of 600 Mbit/s.
