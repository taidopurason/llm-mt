This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (a theory already widespread), but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotene-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into feather development in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have the highly developed barb called rachis, but have other features-rays and hooks-the researchers concluded that rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature control or display.  The researchers hypothesize that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not juvenile ones.
Scientists assume that even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample represents the plumage of an adult animal and not the down feathers of a juvenile.
They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principle as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system is apparently determined by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used to determine the star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic turnover.
The 802.11n standard operates at both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.
Thus, backward compatibility with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g will be possible provided the base station has a dual transmitter.
802.11n speeds are significantly higher than its predecessors with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbit/s.
