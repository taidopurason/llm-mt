This confirms the established theory that at least some dinosaurs have had feathers, while also providing information that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three -dimensional layout.
.Scientists say that the feathers of this animal at the upper side were chestnut brown and on the underside was pastel or carotenoid colored.
The find also offers insight into the development of bird feathers.
Because the dinosaur pen do not have a well -developed sleeve called ribs, but all other properties of feathers - twigs and hooks - researchers found that ribs were very likely to develop later in evolution than other traits.
From the structure of the feathers, we can conclude that they were not used for escape, but to regulate temperature or to show up.Although it is a tail of a young dinosaur, according to researchers, the pattern shows that these are feathers of an adult specimen and not a puppy.

They found that the sun works the same as other stars: all the stars in the system are driven by their excitement and rotation and nothing else.
Exception and circulation are jointly used to determine Rossby's number of stars associated with plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby's number, the less active is the star as regards the replacement of magnetic poles.
The 802.11n standard operates both at 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz.
As a result, it will be compatible with the standards of 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, if the basic station will have a double radio.
The speed of 802.11n is significantly higher than the speed of its predecessors with the maximum theoretical permeability of 600 Mbit/s.
