The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Part of the events will take place in other places in Japan.
From Tokyo, where the 1964 games took place, the only Asian city, where the Olympics have held twice, will be the only one.
If you booked flights and accommodation by 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules are different, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus -based cancellation rules do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were to take place.
The price of most tickets is expected to be in the range of 2500 ¥ and 13 0000 ¥ and the usual tickets cost around 7000 ¥.
