The Paralympics will take place from 24/08/2021 to 05/09/2021. Some events will be held in different locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted it back in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, this situation may be difficult for you.
Event cancellation policies may vary, but as recently as the end of March, most coronavirus-based event cancellation policies did not apply to July 2020, the time the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with regular tickets costing 7,000 Japanese yen.
