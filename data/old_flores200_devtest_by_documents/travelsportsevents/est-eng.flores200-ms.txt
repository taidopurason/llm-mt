The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some of the events take place in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo, where the 1964 Games were held, will become the only Asian city where the Olympic Games have been held twice.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation rules won't extend into July 2020, when the Olympics were supposed to take place.
Most tickets are expected to price between ¥2500 and ¥13,0000, and regular tickets cost around ¥7000.
