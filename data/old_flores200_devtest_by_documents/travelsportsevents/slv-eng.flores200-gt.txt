The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events are held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, the first to be there in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before postponement, you can be in a difficult position.
The cancellation rules are different, but most of the coronavirus failures of the late March are not considered July 2020, when the Olympics are expected to take place.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2500 and 130,000 yen, and regular tickets will cost about 7,000 yen.
