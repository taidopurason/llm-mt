When a small group of living organisms (small population) away from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves via a mountain chain or river or moves to a new island and is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environmentAs she lived before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different qualities or adjustments to be able to deal with them.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
When the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it is less and less similar to another population.
Over time, over a thousand or even millions of years, the populations will seem so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called specialties, which means the formation of new species.Specialty is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
