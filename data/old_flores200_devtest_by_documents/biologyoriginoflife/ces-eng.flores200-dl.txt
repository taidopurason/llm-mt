When a small group of animals (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, when they cross a mountain ridge or river, or move to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), they often find themselves in a different environment from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, in a few thousand or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
