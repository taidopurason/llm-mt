When a small group of living beings (a small population) is released from the main population from which they come from (for example, they move across a mountain range or a river or move to a new island, and return is not easy), they often get into a different environment.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different features of the past and must adapt to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
As time goes by, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they look less and less like another population.
In the end, in thousands of or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process a species blank, which simply means the development of a new species.A species of species is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
