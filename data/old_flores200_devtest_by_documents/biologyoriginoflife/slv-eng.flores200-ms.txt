When a small group of living organisms (a small population) moves away from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island and it is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it lived before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to compete with them.
The source population has not changed in any way, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, over time it is less and less similar to another population.
Over time, thousands or even millions of years from now, the populations will appear to be so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
