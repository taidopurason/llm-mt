Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they have the opportunity, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he himself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, where they can sniff where they have moved on the ground.
They see very well at night thanks to night vision and are able to move very quietly. Ocelots hunt by merging with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
