Direct eaters like to eat small animals. Where possible, they prey on monkeys, worms, rodents and birds. Almost all of the animals hunted by the direwolves are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that direct wolves track and find prey (victims) by smell, sniffing out places where they have been.
They have excellent night vision and are very stealthy. They blend into their environment to hunt prey and then pounce on the prey.
