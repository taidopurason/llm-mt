Ozelotes feed on small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds when they can. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that ozelotes track and search animals for food (prey) by smelling where they are on the ground.
Because of their night vision, they can see very well at night and can also move silently. Ozelotes predate by first blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
