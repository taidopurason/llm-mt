Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional role of navies has been to ensure that a country retains the ability to move people and goods while limiting the enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One such recent example, and the most noteworthy, was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. In order to help Britain, the Americans tried to get men and materiel across the Atlantic.
At the same time, the German navy, particularly with U-boats, wanted to stop this kind of traffic.
Had the Allied forces failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in taking Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
