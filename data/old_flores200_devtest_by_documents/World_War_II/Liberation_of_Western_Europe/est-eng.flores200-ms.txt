D-Day and subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was there that the Vichy ruled by the French. These were the people of France who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940, this action came to be known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and liberated French troops had liberated the southern part of France and turned to Germany.
