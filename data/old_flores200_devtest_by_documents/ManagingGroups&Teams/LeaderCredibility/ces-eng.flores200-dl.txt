Generally speaking, two types of behaviour can occur when managers start to mentor their former colleagues - peers. At one end of the spectrum is the desire to remain "one of them" (or one of them).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person changes beyond recognition and feels they have to change everything the team does and make it their own.
The leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
