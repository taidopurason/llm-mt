In general, when managers start to lead their former peers, this can lead to two types of behaviour. One extreme of the spectrum tries to remain 'one of the boys (or girls)'.
This type of manager finds it difficult to take unpopular decisions, to call to order, to carry out appraisals, to assign responsibilities and to hold staff accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum is the person who becomes unrecognisable, feeling that they have to change everything the team has done so far and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
Such behaviour often causes discord between the leader and the rest of the team.
