When directors start managing their former colleagues, it is generally accepted that they can start behaving in one of two ways. On the one hand, there is a desire to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
Such a leader finds it difficult to take unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, evaluate workers' performance, assign tasks and hold them accountable for mistakes made.
On the other hand, we can turn into an unrecognisable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team has been doing and chart a course of his own.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often creates gaps between leaders and the rest of the team.
