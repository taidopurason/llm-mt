When the manager begins to lead their former peers, it can generally induce two behaviors.One extreme of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the boys (or girls).
It is difficult for this type of manager to make unpopular decisions, call for evaluation, assess, determine obligations and liability to employees.
At the other end of the spectrum, there is a person who changes to an unknown, feeling that he has to change everything the team has done so far and to do it.
Finally, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often causes disagreement between the leaders and the rest of the team.
