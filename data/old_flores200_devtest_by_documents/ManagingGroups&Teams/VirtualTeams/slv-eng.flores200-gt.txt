Virtual groups strive for the same standards of excellence as conventional groups, but there are small differences.
Virtual members of the group often act as a contact point for their direct natural group.
Usually, they have more freedom than ordinary members of the group, as their groups have to adapt to multiple time belts, for which their local leadership sometimes has no ear.
Another characteristic component of the virtual group is the presence of a true "invisible group" (Larson and Lafasto, 1989: 109).
The "invisible team" is a management team reported by individual members.The invisible team sets standards for each member individually.
