Virtual groups strive for the same standards of excellence as conventional groups, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual group members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more freedom than regular group members, as their groups have to adapt to several time zones, which sometimes their local management is not very attentive to.
Another characteristic of a virtual group is the presence of a real 'invisible group' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989: 109).
"The 'invisible team' is the management team to which individual members report. The invisible team sets standards for each individual member.
