Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as touchpoints for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
A unique component of the virtual team is also the presence of the so-called "invisible team" (Larson â€“ LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
An "invisible team" is a management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standards for individual members.
