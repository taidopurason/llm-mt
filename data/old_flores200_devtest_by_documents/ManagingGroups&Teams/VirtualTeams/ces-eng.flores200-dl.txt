Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as focal points for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet on different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
Another unique component of the virtual team is the presence of an "invisible team" (Larson - LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
