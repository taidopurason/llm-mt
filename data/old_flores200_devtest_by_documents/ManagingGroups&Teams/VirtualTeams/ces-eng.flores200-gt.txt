Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of perfection as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often act as contact points of their own physical group.
They often have greater independence than ordinary team members, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
The unique component of the virtual team is also the presence of the so -called "invisible team" (Larson - Lafasto, 1989, p. 109).
The "Invisible Team" is a team of management that every member is subordinate.The invisible team sets standards for individual members.
