Content theories are focused on finding out what can appeal to people or is close to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they embrace as they grow up.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want what they do and what in their environment makes them do or not do things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid theory of needs and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
