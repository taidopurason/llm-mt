Content theories focus on finding what drives people forward or what pleases them.
These theories say that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalise as they grow up.
These theories investigate what it is that makes some people want the things they want and what things in the environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular contextual theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory of motivation.
