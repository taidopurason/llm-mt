Achievement needs theories try to understand what makes people act and what they like.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted as they mature into adults.
These theories are about what makes certain people want the things they do and what environmental factors make them do or not do certain things.
Two of the most popular needs-based theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
