Theories about content focus on finding what drives people forward or what pleases them.
These theories say that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow up.
These theories investigate what it is that makes some people want the things they want, and what things in the environment will make them do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are the Maslow hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor motivational theory.
