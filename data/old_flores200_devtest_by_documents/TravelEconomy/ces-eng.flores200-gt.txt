The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which corresponds to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be replaced in a single bank on the islands located in Stanley, opposite Fic West.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands and in Stanley are also often received by credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, but you may succeed with British and American currency.Be sure to ask the owners in advance what payment method you can use.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so make the shift before leaving them.
