The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes with a width of 3.5 meters.
The vertical clear height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, the operation started only in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is worth one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, but you may succeed with British and American currency. Be sure to ask the owners in advance what payment method you can use.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so make an exchange before you leave them.
