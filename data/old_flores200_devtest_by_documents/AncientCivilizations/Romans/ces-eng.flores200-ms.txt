While most of their dishes would not be alien to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual compositions of feasts, including a wild boar, a peacock, a snail, and a species of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their food sitting on chairs, while rich men liked to feast together and lie on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman dishes could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia only in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
