While most of their meals would not be alien to us, the Romans had their share of special or unusual feast compositions, including a wild boar, a peacock, a snail and a kind of rodent called a dorm.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their food sitting on chairs, while wealthy men liked to organize banquets together and lying on their side while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not include food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had never tasted a turkey.
