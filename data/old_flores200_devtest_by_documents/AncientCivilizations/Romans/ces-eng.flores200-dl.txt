While most of their dishes would be unfamiliar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast compositions, involving wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a plch.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their meals sitting on chairs, while rich men liked to hold feasts together and lie on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that did not reach Europe from the Americas or Asia until later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
