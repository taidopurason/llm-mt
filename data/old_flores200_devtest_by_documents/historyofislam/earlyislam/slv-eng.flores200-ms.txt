Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this earthly life. He visited a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) to contemplate.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very clear idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave, located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely away from the rest of the world.
Basically, it's not easy to find, even knowing it exists. The interior of the cave offers complete solitude.
Apart from the clear, beautiful sky overhead and many of the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. From the inside of the cave you can see or hear little from this world.
