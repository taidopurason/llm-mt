Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside the area of secular life.He often visited the cave known as "hira" on a mountain called "noor" and there contour there.
The cave itself, which has survived a considerable time, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
At its location on the top of one of the mountains north of Mekka, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it at all, even if it is known that it existed.Inside the cave is in complete isolation.
There is nothing but a beautifully bright sky and a large number of surrounding mountains.Very little of this world can be seen and heard from the inside of the cave.
