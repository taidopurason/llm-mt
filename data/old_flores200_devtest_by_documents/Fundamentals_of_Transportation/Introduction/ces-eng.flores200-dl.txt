Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely find a similar level of complaint about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is it something deeper?
