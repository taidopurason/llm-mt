Everyone participates in social life and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely come across a similar level of complaint about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply unfit? Or is it something deeper?
