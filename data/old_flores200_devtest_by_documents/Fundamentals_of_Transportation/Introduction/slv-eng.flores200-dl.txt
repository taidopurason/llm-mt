Everyone in society participates in and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge demolitions.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they fail every day? Is it the incompetence of transport engineers? Or is it perhaps something more fundamental?
