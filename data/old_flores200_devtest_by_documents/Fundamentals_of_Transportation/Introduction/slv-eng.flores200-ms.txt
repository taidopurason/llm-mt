In society, everyone participates and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge demolition.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they fail every day? Is the incompetence of traffic engineers to blame? Or is it perhaps something more fundamental?
