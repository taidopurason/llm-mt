Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or crashing bridges at a similar level.
Why do transport systems generate complaints about daily failures? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
