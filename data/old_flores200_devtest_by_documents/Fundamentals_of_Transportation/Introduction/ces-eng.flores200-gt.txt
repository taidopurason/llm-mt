Everyone participates in life in society and uses traffic systems.Almost everyone complains about traffic systems.
In developed countries you rarely encounter a similar degree of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transport systems evoke so many complaints, why do they fail every day?Are traffic engineers just unfit?Or is it something deeper?
