In society, everyone is involved and used transport systems.Almost all of them complain about transport systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge demolition.
Why are there so many complaints at the expense of transport systems, why do they fail every day?Is it to blame for traffic engineers?Or maybe it's something more fundamental?
