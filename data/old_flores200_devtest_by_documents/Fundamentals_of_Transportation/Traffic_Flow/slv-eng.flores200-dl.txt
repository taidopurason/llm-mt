Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, driver behaviour is generally settled to some extent, so traffic flows are also settled and can be roughly represented in mathematical form.
To better illustrate traffic flows, relationships between the three main characteristics (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed have been established.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roadways.
