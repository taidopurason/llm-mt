Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Investigating the flow of traffic is unfortunately difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a certain range; therefore, traffic usually has some reasonable consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
