Traffic flow is a study that looks at the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
The study of traffic flows, unfortunately, is difficult, since it is impossible to predict the behavior of the driver with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, so traffic flows tend to be somewhat reasonably consistent and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better describe the traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These links contribute to the design, design and operation of roadway facilities.
