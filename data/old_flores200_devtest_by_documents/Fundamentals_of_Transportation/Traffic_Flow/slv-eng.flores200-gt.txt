Traffic flow is to study the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult, as the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100 % certainty.
Thankfully, the behavior of drivers is generally established to some extent, so traffic flows are also established and can be roughly presented in mathematical form.
In order to better illustrate the flow of traffic, the relationships between the main three characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help to design, design and operate roads.
