A traffic flow is a study that looks at the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent way, so traffic flows tend to be somewhat reasonably consistent and can be roughly mathematically represented.
In order to better describe traffic flows, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roadway facilities.
