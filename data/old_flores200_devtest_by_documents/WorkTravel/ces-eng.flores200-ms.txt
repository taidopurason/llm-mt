An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a year off is to travel and learn.
It's especially popular with people who are finishing school. It allows them to take a year off before entering university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad after leaving secondary school can improve your chances of higher education in your home country.
Tuition fees will usually be charged for enrolment in these educational programs.
