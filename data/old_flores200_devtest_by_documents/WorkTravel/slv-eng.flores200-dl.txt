An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year between school is to travel and study.
It is particularly popular with final year students as it gives them a year off before starting their studies without having to sacrifice their education.
It is often the case that studying abroad for a year actually increases the likelihood of a person continuing their studies in their home country.
Usually, there is a tuition fee to attend these educational programmes.
