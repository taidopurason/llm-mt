The work was mostly theoretical, but the programme was written to stimulate observations of the Ambur galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, causing troughs, the Milky Way exerts a pull on the Amburi Galaxy.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in the form of a crown, and is made up of many small particles.
