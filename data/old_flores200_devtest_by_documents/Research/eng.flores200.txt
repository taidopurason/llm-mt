The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just like the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that the dark matter affect other dark matter in the same way regular matter does.
This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of lots of small particles.
