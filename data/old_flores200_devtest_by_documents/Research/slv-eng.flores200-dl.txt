The work done was mostly theoretical, but a programme was written to simulate observations of the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect the team wanted to achieve would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and causes tidal forces, the Milky Way exerts a tidal force on the constellation Sagittarius.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter acts on other dark matter in a similar way to normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is thought to be in the form of a ring made up of many small particles.
