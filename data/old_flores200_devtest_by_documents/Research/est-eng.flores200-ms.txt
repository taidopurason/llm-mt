The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pulling force on the earth, causing ebbs, the Milky Way exerts its power on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark substances in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter that is around the galaxy is located around the galaxy as a crown, and it consists of many small particles.
