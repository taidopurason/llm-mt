Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly made them more adept at avoiding enemies and more efficient at finding food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them even more options for hiding from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings along their bodies are dragonflies and damselflies.
