Insects were the first animals to take off into the air.Their ability to fly allowed them to avoid enemies and find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage that their wings can fold back along the body.
This provides them with a larger selection of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Nowadays, they are the only insects that cannot fold wings, dragonflies and needles.
