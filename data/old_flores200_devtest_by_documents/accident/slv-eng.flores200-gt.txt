Although there were three people in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed so that the emergency assistance services could be liberated from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Adenbrook's Hospital in Cambridge.
