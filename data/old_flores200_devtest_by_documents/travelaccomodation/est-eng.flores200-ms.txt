Booking in advance gives the passenger peace of mind that they have a sleeping place when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can find other accommodation options, such as campgrounds, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, shuttle to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your booking if you want to reflect on the offer or get other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes and applications should first be discussed with the tour operator and not directly with the hotel.
