Booking in advance gives travellers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can find other accommodation options, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport from/to the airport, or even flight and hotel combos.
They can also hold your booking if you want to think about the offer or obtain other documents (e.g. visas) for the destination.
Any changes or requests should be discussed with the tour operator first, not directly with the hotel.
