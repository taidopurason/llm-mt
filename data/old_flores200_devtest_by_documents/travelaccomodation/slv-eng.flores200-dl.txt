By booking in advance, travellers can be sure that they will have a place to sleep when they get to their chosen destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers and even joint air and hotel packages.
They can also hold your booking if you need to reconsider the offer or obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any adjustments and preferences should be communicated to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
