Reservation of accommodation in advance brings the traveler the certainty that he will have his way to sleep.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it is possible to book other forms of accommodation as a camp.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport or even combined packages of tickets and hotel.
They can also hold a reservation if you need time to think about or to provide other document documents (eg visa).
Any modifications or applications should be directed first on a travel agent and not directly to the hotel address.
