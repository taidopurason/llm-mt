A nuclear bomb operates on the principle that it takes energy to put the cell nucleus together with many protons and neutrons.
Much like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Re-splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they tend to decay on a small bump or spontaneously.
