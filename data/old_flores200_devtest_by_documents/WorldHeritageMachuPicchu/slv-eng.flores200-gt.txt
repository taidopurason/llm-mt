Mach Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the intahuatan, the solar tower and the shrine of three windows.
Most buildings at the edges of the complex were rebuilt to make tourists imagine how originally they looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the renovation continues today.
