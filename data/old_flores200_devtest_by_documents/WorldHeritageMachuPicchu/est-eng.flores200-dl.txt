Machu Picchu consists of three main structures - namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the periphery of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 per cent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
