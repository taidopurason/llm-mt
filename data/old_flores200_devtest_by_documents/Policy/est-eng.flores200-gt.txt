The shooters involved in the additional pest control test were strictly monitored by the forest watchers because the test was under track and its effectiveness was evaluated.
The NPWS and Australian Shooting Athlete Association (NSW) Company (NSW) Company recruited the qualified volunteer shooting athletes on the basis of the Association of Shooting Athletes.
According to Mick O'flynn, Acting Director of the NPWS Park, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation were thorough safety instructions and training.
