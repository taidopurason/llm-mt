The shooters participating in the additional pest control experiment were closely monitored by forest rangers, as the experiment was under surveillance and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited under the Shooting Sportsmen's Association of Australia (NSW) hunting program in partnership with NPWS.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS Park, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
