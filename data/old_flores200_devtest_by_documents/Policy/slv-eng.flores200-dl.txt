The shooters in the additional pest control experiment were under the watchful eye of the wardens as the test is monitored and its effectiveness is evaluated.
Qualified volunteers are being recruited under the auspices of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program in collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS Executive Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training guidance.
