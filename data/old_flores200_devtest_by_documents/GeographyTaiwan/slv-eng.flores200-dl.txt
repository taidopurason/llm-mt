Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing past the island called it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in south-western Taiwan and began transforming indigenous grain production methods and recruiting Chinese labourers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the military forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's west and north coasts and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
