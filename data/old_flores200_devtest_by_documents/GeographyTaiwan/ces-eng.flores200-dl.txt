The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing nearby recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning the transformation of indigenous grain production practices by employing Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the southwest and northern coast of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. The latter ruled the island until 1945.
