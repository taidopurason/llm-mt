Taiwan was mentioned in the 15th century, when European sailors sailed the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East Indian Company founded a base in Taiwan, southwest of the East Indian Company, initiating the transformation of indigenous cereal production practices and hiring Chinese workers in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took the coastal areas of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan as the Qing Empire province in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the first China-Japan (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty Government signed the Shimonosec Peace Treaty, which transferred Taiwan to the right of governance to Japan, which prevailed until 1945.
