South Shetland, which was discovered in 1819, is claimed by more countries and has the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120km north of the mainland. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau, then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Ridge, is Antarctica's highest mountain range, the Vinson Massif, with its 4,892-metre-high peak, Mount Vinson.
