Discovered in 1819, South Shetland Islands are claimed by more landers and have the most bases â€“ 16 were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the mainland. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge here into a plateau, and then reappear to form a 360 km long chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or in the Sentinel ridge is the highest mountain range of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif with the 4892 meters high peak of Mount Vinson.
