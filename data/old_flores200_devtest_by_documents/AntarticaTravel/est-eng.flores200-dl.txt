The islands of South Shetland, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases - 16 active bases as of 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where a crater flooded by a hitherto active volcano forms a prominent natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is an area south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge with the lava, then rise again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are Antarctica's highest mountains - the Vinson Massif - with the highest peak at 4,892 m Vinson Mountain.
