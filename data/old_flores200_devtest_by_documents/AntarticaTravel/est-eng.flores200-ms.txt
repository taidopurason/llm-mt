The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several countries, and have the largest number of bases – 16 active bases as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of a hitherto active volcano forms an outstanding natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula mountains blend in with the lava land here, then re-emerge and form the 360km-long Ellsworth Mountain Range, which is cut in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel mountain range are the highest mountains in Antarctica—the Vinson Massif—whose highest peak is Mount Vinson, 4892 m high.
