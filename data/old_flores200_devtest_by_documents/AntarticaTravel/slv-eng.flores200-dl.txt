Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are a multi-national group with the largest number of bases, 16 of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano serves as a stunning natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the landscape to the south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau, then re-emerge as the 360km Ellsworth Mountain Range, which is eroded by a glacier in Minnesota.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Mountain chain is the highest mountain range in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising 4892 m high.
