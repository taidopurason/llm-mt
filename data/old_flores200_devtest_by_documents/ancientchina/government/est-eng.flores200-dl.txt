Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods of time; each stage of Chinese history or each family in power had a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable era of divided provinces between each dynasty. The best known of these eras was the era of the three kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there was fierce fighting between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms Era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in fights between themselves in the hope of gaining the highest seat of power in the Grand Palace of Xi'an.
