Ancient China had a unique way of describing different time periods; each stage of Chinese history or each family in power had a separate dynasty.
Also, the era of divided provinces was unstable between each dynasty. The best known of these eras was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce fighting took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The era of the three countries was one of the bloodiest times in the history of ancient China â€“ thousands of people were killed in the fighting between them because they hoped to gain the highest position of power in the Grand Palace of Xi'an.
