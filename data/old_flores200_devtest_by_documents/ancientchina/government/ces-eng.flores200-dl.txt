Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each era of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there was a fierce war between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms Era was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, when thousands died in the struggle to gain the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
