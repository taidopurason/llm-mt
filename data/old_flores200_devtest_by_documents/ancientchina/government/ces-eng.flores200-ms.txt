Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each time of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Epoch of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China, when thousands of people died fighting for the throne in the Grand Palace of Xi'an.
