Mallorcan cuisine, like the cuisine of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and often uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is called Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
