Majorcan cuisine, like cuisine in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), all using olive oil.
A simple and popular dish, especially in summer, is amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and all kinds of accompaniments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
