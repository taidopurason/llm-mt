Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, the two countries came to blows over clashes of system, process and culture.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and proxy armies had to fight real wars on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
