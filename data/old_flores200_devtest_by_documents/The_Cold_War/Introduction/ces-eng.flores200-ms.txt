Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. The clashes of the system, processes and culture led to the breakdown of cooperation between the countries with the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted another 40 years, and was indeed fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
