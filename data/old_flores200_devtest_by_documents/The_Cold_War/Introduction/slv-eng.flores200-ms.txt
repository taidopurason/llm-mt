Since Germany was a common enemy during World War 2, the USSR and the USA began to cooperate. After the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural contradictions led to division between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years and fought for real, with the help of proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
