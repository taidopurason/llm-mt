Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. Clashes of system, process and culture led to a breakdown in cooperation between the countries as the war ended.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted another 40 years and was indeed fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
