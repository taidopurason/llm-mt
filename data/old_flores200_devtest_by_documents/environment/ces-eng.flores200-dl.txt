At 10:08 p.m. Monday, a moderate earthquake shook western Montana.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) and its National Earthquake Information Center received no immediate reports of damage.
The epicenter of the quake was about 20 km (15 miles) north-northeast of Dillon and about 65 km (40 miles) south of Butte.
Five minutes before the fireworks began, winds began to pick up, and about a minute later they were already reaching speeds of 70 km/h... Then the rain came, but so hard it was hitting you in the face like needles, then the hail started, people were panicking, screaming and running around in confusion.
I lost my sister and her friend and there were two disabled people in wheelchairs in the way and people were just jumping over them and pushing them away," Armand Versace said.
NHK also reported that the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata Prefecture was operating normally.
Hokuriku Electric Power Co. said the quake had no effects and that reactors 1 and 2 at its Shika nuclear power plant were shut down.
Approximately 9 400 households in the area were reported without water and approximately 100 households without electricity.
Some roads have been damaged, rail traffic has stopped in the affected areas and Noto airport in Ishikawa Prefecture remains closed.
