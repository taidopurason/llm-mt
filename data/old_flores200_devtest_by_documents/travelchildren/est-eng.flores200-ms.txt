For children, the sound and light performance of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in this area.
Before the start of the performance, you can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can watch them in silence.
Usually you can always hear the voices of tourists and traders. Sound and light tell the story just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is made a spectacle background and the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated with lights.
