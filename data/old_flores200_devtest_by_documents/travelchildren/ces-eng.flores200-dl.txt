The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most exciting things for kids in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show starts.
You can usually hear the tourists and vendors all the time. The story of the sounds and lights is like a storybook.
The sphinx acts as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Various scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the pyramids are gradually illuminated.
