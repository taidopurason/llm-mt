A terrified Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to leave Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a gang of Parisian Turons.
They travelled back to Paris in a barge, surrounded by a mob shouting and shouting threats at the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of the arch open.
At one point, one of the members of the crowd waved in front of the Queen the head of the slain royal guard of Versailles.
