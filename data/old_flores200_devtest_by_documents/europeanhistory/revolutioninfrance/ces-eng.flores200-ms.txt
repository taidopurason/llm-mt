A terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Elizabeth Philippine of France were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
They drove back to Paris in a carriage that surrounded the turbulent crowd, shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of a criminal group waved the head of the royal guard in front of the horrified queen.
