Frightened Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to leave Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a gang of Parisian market women.
They traveled back to Paris, surrounded by a mob screaming and screaming threats in the direction of the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the windows of the chariot open.
At one point, one of the members of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
