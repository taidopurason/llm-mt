The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Maria Antoinette, their young children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the royal sister, Mrs Elizabeth, were forced by an enraged crowd of defenders to withdraw from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris by a chariot surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats to the king and queen.
A crowd of people forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage wide open.
At one point, someone from the crowd waved the head of a member of the royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
