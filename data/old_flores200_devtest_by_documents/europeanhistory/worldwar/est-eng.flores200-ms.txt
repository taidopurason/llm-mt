Not long after the start of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective â€“ it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated the generally accepted international law enshrined in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain installed mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, putting even neutral bases at risk.
Since there was no particular reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
