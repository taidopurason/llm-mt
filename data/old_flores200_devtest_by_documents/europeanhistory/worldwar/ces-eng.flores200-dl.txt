Soon after the clashes broke out, Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated universally accepted international law codified in several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain cruised international waters to keep any ships out of entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic met with only a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted undersea military forces.
