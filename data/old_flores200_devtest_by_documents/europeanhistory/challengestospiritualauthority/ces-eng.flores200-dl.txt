During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had acquired wealth and power, became the target of close scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power has influenced everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the monetary resources of the Church are there for that very purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for over 1,000 years. This concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been fulfilled.
