For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the most common film size at the height of the analogue film era.
They are still produced today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio has been adopted by digital camera sensor formats.
Although somewhat confusing, the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio in whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
