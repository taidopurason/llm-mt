For example, the most common photo film format in the world is 35mm, dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions were inherited to the dimensions of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing 36 mm wide and 24 mm long.
The image ratio of this format (by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore believed to be 3: 2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format group) are equal to or close to it.
