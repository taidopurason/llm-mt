For example, the most common photofilm format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its propositions bequeathed to the dimensions of the image sensors of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusingly 36mm wide and 24mm long.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore believed to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, a group of APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
