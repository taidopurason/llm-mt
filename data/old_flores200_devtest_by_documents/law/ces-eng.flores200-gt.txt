Representatives of Amsterdam and the Anna Frank Museum claims that the tree is attacked by a sponge and rebuilds the risk of public health because it could fall at any time.
The felling was scheduled for Tuesday, but this was prevented by an extraordinary court decision.
Chambers sued God for "the spread of death, ravation and terrorization of millions of the country's inhabitants."
Agnostic Chambers claims that his indictment is "unfounded" and "anyone can sue anyone".
