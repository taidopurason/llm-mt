Because Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is when it is cold in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; temperatures above 30 Â°C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but combined with the wind and humidity, it seems colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: rainfall amounts remain about the same throughout the year.
