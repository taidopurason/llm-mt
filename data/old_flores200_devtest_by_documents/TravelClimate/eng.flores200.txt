Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30Â°C are common.
The winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain stays roughly the same throughout the year.
