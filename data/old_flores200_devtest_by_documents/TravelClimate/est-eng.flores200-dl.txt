Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30Â°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific wet or dry seasons: rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
