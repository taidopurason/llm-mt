Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer is there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30 Â°C are normal.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but wind and humidity together create a colder feeling than shown on the thermometer.
There are no specific rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year.
