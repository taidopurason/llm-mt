In the United States, there are about 400,000 known multiple sclerosis (MS) cases, which makes it a leading neurological disease among young people and middle -aged adults.
Multisklerosis is a central nervous system consisting of a disease of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research found that the presence of MS is twice as likely to be in women than men.
