All of the cave entrances, which have been named "Seven Sisters", are at least 100 to 250 metres (328 to 820 feet) in diameter.
Infrared photos show how the temperature differences between day and night indicate that these are probably caves.
"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal variations are not as stable as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but this is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff.
The ASUS Eee PC, previously marketed globally for its economy and functionality, became a hot topic at Computer Science Month in Taipei in 2007.
However, the consumer laptop market was radically shaken and transformed after ASUS was awarded the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award by the Premier of the Government of the Republic of China.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number yet on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software in early February and was announced Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of the Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets have formed, especially how the Earth has been shaped since comets collided with Earth long ago.
The study, published Thursday in the journal Science, describes the emergence of new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden said the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process was thought to take much longer due to reproduction among endemic finches, Darwin's finches and immigrant cactus and cone-billed finches.
