All entrances to the cave, which have been named "Seven Sisters", are at least 100 to 250 meters (328 to 820 feet) in diameter.
Infrared photos show temperature differences between day and night that they are probably caves.
"They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their heat changes are not as stable as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but this is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrology team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona, located in Flagstaff.
Previously launched globally for efficiency and functionality, ASUS Eee PC became a hot topic at Taipei Computer Month in 2007.
However, the consumer market for laptops will be radically shaken and transformed after ASUS was awarded the Taiwan Sustainable Award by the Prime Minister of the Republic of China in 2007.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery using various hardware and software was verified by several people in early February and announced on Tuesday.
Comets can be a source of water supply on earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth has formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process was thought to take much longer, due to breeding among endemic finches, Darwin's middle finches, and immigrant cactus and conic finches.
