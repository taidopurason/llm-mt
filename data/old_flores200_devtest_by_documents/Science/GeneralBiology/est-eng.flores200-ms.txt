The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence suggesting that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, noting in the DNA phage either radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germinal line cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited from children, mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
