Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence suggesting that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phage, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, either labelling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
