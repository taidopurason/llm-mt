The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main proofs that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether germline cells were affected.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
