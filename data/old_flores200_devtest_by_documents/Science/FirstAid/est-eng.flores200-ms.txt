Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general and do not allow to immediately diagnose.
A clear sign of poison ingested or drunk may be an open pack of drugs or toxic household chemicals that are located nearby.
Look on the label for instructions for first aid for a particular poison.
