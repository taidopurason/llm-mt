Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions in the case of that particular poison.
