Internal poisoning is not always the most obvious. Signs such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The main sign indicating internal poisoning is the possible presence of an open package with drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Check on the label whether specific first aid instructions are given exactly for this poison.
