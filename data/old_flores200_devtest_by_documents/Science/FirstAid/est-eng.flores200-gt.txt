Inner poisoning may not be immediately apparent.Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general and do not allow immediately diagnosis.
A clear sign of the poisoned or drunk poison may be an open drug pack or toxic household chemicals that are nearby.
See the label instructions for providing first aid for a particular poison.
