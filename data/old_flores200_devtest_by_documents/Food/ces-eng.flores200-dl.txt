German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are rich and varied, very similar to their southern neighbours in Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apples are used in pastries all year round, then cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds and hazelnuts and other nuts. The popular desserts are often especially good with a cup of strong coffee.
