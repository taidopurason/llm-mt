For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival-goers choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this a key part of the experience.
If you want to be in the heart of the action, you need to get there early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Although the music on the main stages may be turned down, it is worth bearing in mind that some venues at the festival may have music playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping spots for families with young children.
