In the case of some festivals, the substantial majority of visitors will decide to camp on the spot and most participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the center, you will need to come as soon as possible to get a place for camping located near music production.
Remember, even though the music on the main stage may have ended, music can continue in other festival sections until late night.
Some festivals include special camps for families with small children.
