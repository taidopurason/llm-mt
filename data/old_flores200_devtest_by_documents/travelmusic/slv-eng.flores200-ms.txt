For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival goers choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it a key part of the experience.
If you want to be at the center of the action, you need to go there early to get a camping spot near the music.
Although the music on the main stages may go silent, it is worth noting that at some venues of the festival music may play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping sites for families with young children.
