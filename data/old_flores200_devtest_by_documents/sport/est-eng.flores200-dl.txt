The games started in beautiful weather at 10:00 and apart from a mid-morning mist that quickly cleared, it was a great day for rugby-7.
South Africa, who were the first seeds in the tournament, started off on the right foot with a comfortable 26 : 00 victory over fifth seeds Zambia.
Playing against their southern neighbours, South Africa left a very rusty impression, but steadily improved as the tournament progressed.
Their disciplined defence, ball handling skills and excellent teamwork set them apart and it was clear that they would have to be overcome to win.
South Africa defeated New Zealand's All Blacks in a three-nation Rugby Union match at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, South Africa.
The final result was a one-point win, 21:20, which ended the All Blacks' 15-match winning streak.
For the Springboks, it ended a five-match losing streak.
For the All Blacks, it was their last match, having already won first place two weeks ago.
The final match of the series will take place next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg when the Springboks play Australia.
