The match kicked off at 10:00am in great weather and with the exception of a morning shower that quickly cleared, it was a great day for sevens rugby.
The top seeded South African team took a step in the right direction, winning comfortably against fifth seeded Zambia by a score of 26-00.
Although their play clearly creaked in the match against their southern sisters, South Africa steadily improved throughout the tournament.
Their defensive discipline, ball handling and excellent teamwork made them stand out and it was certain that this was the team to beat.
South Africa defeated the All Blacks (New Zealand) in a rugby match at the Tri Nations tournament at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in South Africa.
The final score was a one-point win 21 to 20, ending the All Blacks' 15-game winning streak.
For the Springboks, it ended a five-match losing streak.
It was the last game for the All Blacks, who had already won the trophy two weeks earlier.
The final match of the series will be played next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, where the Springboks will play Australia.
