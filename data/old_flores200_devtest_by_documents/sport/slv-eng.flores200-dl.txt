The games started at 10.00 with perfect weather and, apart from a few drops of rain in the middle of the morning, which soon stopped, it was a perfect day for rugby sevens.
South Africa, the tournament favourite, started well, winning easily 26:00 against fifth seed Zambia.
Although acting a little out of form against their southern sisters, South Africa steadily progressed as the tournament unfolded.
They stood out for their disciplined defence, skilful ball handling and excellent teamwork and it was clear that they were going to be the main opposition.
The South Africans defeated the All Blacks (New Zealand) in the Rugby Union Tri-Nations Championship at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, South Africa.
The final result was a one-point victory, 21 to 20, which broke the All Blacks' winning streak of 15 consecutive matches.
For the Springboks, it snapped a run of five consecutive match defeats.
It was the last match for the All Blacks, who won the trophy two weeks ago.
The final match in the series will take place next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg when the Springboks take on Australia.
