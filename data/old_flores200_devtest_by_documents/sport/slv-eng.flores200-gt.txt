The games started at 10.00 with excellent weather and, with the exception of a few drops of rain in the middle of the morning, which soon subsided, the day was perfect for rugby week.
South Africa, the favorite of the tournament, began well when she won 26:00 against the fifth Zambia seed.
Although it worked little out of form in the match against its southern sisters, South Africa has been steadily advancing by unfolding the tournament.
They stood out for their disciplined defense, skillful handling of the ball and excellent teamwork, and it was clear that it was the main opponent.
The South Africans defeated All Blackse (New Zealand) at the Championships of the Three Nations Rugbian Federation at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in South Africa Rustenburg.
The end result was one point victory, 21 to 20, which broke the winning set of 15 consecutive All Blacks.
For Springbox, a series of five consecutive defeats in the matches was interrupted.
For All Blackse, who won the cup two weeks ago, this was the last game.
The last match in this series will take place next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg when Springboxes will compete with Australia.
