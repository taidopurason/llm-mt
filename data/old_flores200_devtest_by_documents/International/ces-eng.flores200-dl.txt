UN peacekeepers who arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake are blamed for spreading a disease that broke out near the troops' camp.
According to the lawsuit, waste from the UN camp was not properly disinfected, allowing bacteria to enter a tributary of the Artibonite River, one of Haiti's largest.
Prior to the arrival of the troops, Haiti had not faced problems associated with the disease since the early 19th century.
The Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti has cited independent studies that suggest the disease was unwittingly brought to Haiti by Nepalese UN peacekeepers.
Danielle Lantagne, a U.N. expert on the disease, said the epidemic was likely caused by peacekeepers.
