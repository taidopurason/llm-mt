UN peacekeepers who arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake are being blamed for the spread of a disease that started near the troop camp.
According to the lawsuit, the UN camp's waste remediation was inadequate, leading to the introduction of bacteria into a tributary of the Artibonite River, one of Haiti's largest.
Until the arrival of the troops, Haiti had not faced problems related to this disease since the 19th century.
The Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy has cited independent research showing that the UN Nepalese peacekeepers unwittingly transferred the disease to Haiti.
Danielle Lantagne, the UN expert on the disease, stated that the outbreak was probably caused by peacekeepers.
