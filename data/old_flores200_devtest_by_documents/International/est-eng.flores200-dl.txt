UN peacekeepers who arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake are blamed for the spread of the disease, which originated at the soldiers' camp.
According to the lawsuit, the UN camp had not been properly disinfected, allowing bacteria to enter the tributaries of the Artibonite, one of Haiti's largest rivers.
Prior to the arrival of the soldiers, Haiti had not had a disease problem since the 1800s.
The Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy has cited independent research that the disease was unknowingly brought to Haiti by a UN peacekeeping battalion in Nepal.
Danielle Lantagne, a UN expert on the disease, said the outbreak was probably caused by peacekeepers.
