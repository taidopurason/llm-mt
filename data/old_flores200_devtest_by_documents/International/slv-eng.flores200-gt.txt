Members of the UN peacekeeping mission, who came to Haita after the 2010 earthquake, are to blame for the spread of the disease that began near the Chet Camp.
According to the lawsuit, the rehabilitation of waste from the UN camp was not appropriate, which caused the intake of bacteria into the tributary of the Artibonite River, which is one of the largest in Haiti.
Until the arrival of the troops, Haiti had not faced the problems associated with the disease since the 19th century.
The Haitian Institute of Justice and Democracy referred to independent research showing that the Nepalese Peace Forces have unknowingly transferred the disease to Haiti.
Danielle Lantagne, UN expert for this disease, stated that the outbreak was probably caused by peacekeepers.
