UN peacekeepers who arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake are blamed for the spread of the disease, which began outside the soldiers' camp.
According to the lawsuit, the UN camp was not properly disinfected, which is why the bacteria escaped into the Artibonite tributary of one of Haiti's largest rivers.
Before the arrival of the soldiers, Haiti had no problems with the disease since the 1800s.
The Haitian Institute for Law and Democracy has cited independent studies that show that the disease was unknowingly brought to Haiti by a UN peacekeeping battalion in Nepal.
Danielle Lantagne, a UN expert on the disease, argued that the outbreak was likely caused by peacekeepers.
