A UN peacekeeping force that arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake has been blamed for spreading the disease, which broke out near the troops' camp.
According to the lawsuit, waste from the UN camp was not properly disinfected, allowing bacteria to enter a tributary of the Artibonite River, one of Haiti's largest.
Before the arrival of the troops, Haiti had not encountered problems associated with this disease since the beginning of the 19th century.
The Institute of Justice and Democracy in Haiti has cited independent studies suggesting that the disease was unwittingly brought to Haiti by the UN peacekeepers in Nepal.
Danielle Lantagne, a UN expert on the disease, said the outbreak was likely caused by peacekeepers.
