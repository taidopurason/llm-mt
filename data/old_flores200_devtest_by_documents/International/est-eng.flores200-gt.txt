The UN peacekeepers who arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake are accused of the spread of the disease that began at the Soldiers' Camp.
According to the case, the UN camp was not properly disinfected, so bacteria entered the tributary of one of the largest rivers of Haiti.
Before the soldiers arrived, Hait had no problems with the disease from the 1800s.
The Haitian Institute of Law and Democracy has referred to independent research stating that the Nepalian UN Peace Guard Battalion unknowingly brought the disease to Haiti.
Danielle Lantagne, a UN expert on this disease, stated that the outbreak was likely to be caused by peacekeepers.
