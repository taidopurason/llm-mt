Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic shaken by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of a self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any member of the UN.
Economic links have been restored between these parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
