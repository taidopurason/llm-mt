Today, the tenth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Subtropical Storm Jerry, formed in the Atlantic Ocean.
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) says Jerry poses no threat to the mainland at this time.
The U.S. Technical Corps estimates that 15 cm of rainfall could lead to the rupture of already damaged levees.
Ninth Ward, which was flooded to a height of 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, now has waist-length water for an adult because a nearby levee overflowed.
Water overflows over the dam on a 30-metre-wide section.
