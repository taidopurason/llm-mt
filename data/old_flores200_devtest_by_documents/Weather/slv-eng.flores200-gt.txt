Today, the tenth called cyclone in the Atlantic Hurricane season, subtropical cyclone Jerry, was created in the Atlantic Ocean.
According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Jerry is currently not a danger to the province.
American engineers estimate that an additional 6 inches of rain could break damaged dams.
The ninth administrative area, where Katrina floods also reached a height of 20 feet among the hurricane, is currently underwater up to the waist as water has poured a nearby embankment.
The water spills over the embankment over 100 feet wide.
