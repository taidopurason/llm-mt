Today, the tenth named cyclone of the Atlantic hurricane season, Subtropical Cyclone Jerry, formed in the Atlantic Ocean.
According to the National Hurricane Centre (NHC), Jerry does not pose a threat to the landscape at this time.
US engineers estimate that an additional 6 inches of rain could break through already damaged levees.
The Ninth Administrative District, where flooding reached up to 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, is currently under waist-deep water as water overtopped a nearby levee.
Water is spilling over the levee in a 100-foot-wide section.
