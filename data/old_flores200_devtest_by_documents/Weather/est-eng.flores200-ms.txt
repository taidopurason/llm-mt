The tenth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, subtropical Storm Jerry, formed today in the Atlantic Ocean.
According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Jerry is no longer a land threat at this time.
The U.S. Corps of Engineers estimates that 6 inches of rainfall could break through previously damaged dams.
Ninth Ward, which was hit by a flood as high as 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, currently has waist-high water as a nearby dam began to overwhelm.
Water is driven over a 100-foot-wide section of the dam.
