Today, the tenth named cyclone in the Atlantic Hurricane season, the subtropical cyclone Jerry, has formed in the Atlantic Ocean.
According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Jerry does not currently pose a threat to the landscape.
American engineers estimate that an additional 6 inches of rain could break through already damaged dams.
The ninth administrative area, where flooding also reached a height of 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, is currently underwater to the waist as water has spilled a nearby embankment.
Water spills over the embankment at a 100-foot wide section.
