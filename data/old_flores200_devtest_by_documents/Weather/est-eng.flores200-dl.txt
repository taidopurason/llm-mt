The tenth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, subtropical storm Jerry, formed in the Atlantic today.
According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Jerry is no longer a threat to land.
The U.S. Corps of Engineers estimates that 6 inches of rainfall could break through previously damaged levees.
The Ninth Ward, which was hit by a 20-foot flood during Hurricane Katrina, is currently under waist-deep water as a nearby dam began to overtop.
Water is overtopping a 100-foot-wide section of the dam.
