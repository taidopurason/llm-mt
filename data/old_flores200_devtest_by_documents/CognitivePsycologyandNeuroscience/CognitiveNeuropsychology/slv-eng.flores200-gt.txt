Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approach to cognition research.So they narrow the research area and significantly increase its accuracy.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports theses in research research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate never seen brain structures and processes.
This gives a lot of information and materials for the construction of simulation models that help us understand how processes are in our minds.
