Neurobiological data provide physical records to the theoretical approach to the cognition.They thus narrow and specify this research area.
Scientists in their research support the mutual link between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and examine the brain structures and yet unseen processes.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our mind.
