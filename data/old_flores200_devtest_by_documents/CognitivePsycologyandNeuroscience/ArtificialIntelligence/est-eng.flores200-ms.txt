Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, AI forms are a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
The study of AI involves automating machines in such a way that they solve tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include verification, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on the search for solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, and is also built into a number of home computers and video game software applications.
