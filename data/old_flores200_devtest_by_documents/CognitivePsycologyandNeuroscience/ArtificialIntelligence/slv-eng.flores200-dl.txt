Although AI has a strong science fiction flavour, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate industries that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it is embedded in many PC and video game software.
