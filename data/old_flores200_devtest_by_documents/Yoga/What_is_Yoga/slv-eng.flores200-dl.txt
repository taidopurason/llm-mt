The amount of inner peace one has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every human being has the potential to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment can be attained by everyone. The only obstacle on the way to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
