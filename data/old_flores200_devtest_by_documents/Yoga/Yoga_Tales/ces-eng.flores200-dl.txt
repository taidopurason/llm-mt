Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded to include the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are basically very simple. They are kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through the postures of this yoga, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centre of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
