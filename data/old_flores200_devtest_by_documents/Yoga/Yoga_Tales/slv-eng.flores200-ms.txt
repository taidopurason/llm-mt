Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it also looks back on the Mahayana Path of Love and the many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini yoga with yogic postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations allows you to awaken kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment).
The central Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. By visualizing different deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
