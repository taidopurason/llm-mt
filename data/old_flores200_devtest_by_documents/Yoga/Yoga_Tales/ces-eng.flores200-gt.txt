Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddh's teachings, but has been extended by the Mahayan path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are basically very simple.They are Kundalin's yoga, meditation and the path of all -encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the energy of Kundalini (enlightenment energy) is awakened by the positions of this yoga, respiratory exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centerpiece of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga.Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and an enlightened consciousness is created.
