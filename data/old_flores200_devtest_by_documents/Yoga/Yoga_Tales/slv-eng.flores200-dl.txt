Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it also looks to the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is, in principle, very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini yoga uses yogic postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations to awaken the kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment).
The central Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. By visualising different deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
