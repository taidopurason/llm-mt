Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was extended with the mahayana love path and several Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. This includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the journey of all-encompassing love.
With the help of yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened in Kundalini Yoga.
The centerpiece of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deities. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
