Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and a number of Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations, Kundalini Yoga awakens the energy of Kundalini (enlightenment energy).
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deities. Through the visualisation of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and an unenlightened consciousness is created.
