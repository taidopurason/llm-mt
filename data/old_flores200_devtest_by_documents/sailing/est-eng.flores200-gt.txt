Finland is a great destination for a boat ride.It also has a thousand islands in the land of a thousand lakes, which are located in lakes and in the coastal islands.
You do not necessarily need a yacht to drive between the islands and the lakes.
Although coastal archipelago and larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks allow for a different experience.
A boat ride is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven to eight people.
The indicators in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are equivalent, but otherwise it is a unique phenomenon (eg this number in the Netherlands is one forty).
Most of the different Baltic Sea cruises contain a longer stop in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you have a couple of days to visit the historic city, while you can return to the ship for the night and sleep there.
If you only go to the shore with ship tours, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
The brochures of some hobby trips highlight the German city of Berlin.As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and visiting this city is not included in the price of a hobby.
