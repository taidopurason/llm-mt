Finland is a great boating destination. In addition, the "land of thousands of lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in lakes and in archipelagos along the coast.
You don't need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaking offer a different experience.
Boating is a Finnish state sport, as every seventh or eighth person has a boat.
The same is the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite rare (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most special Baltic cruisers involve an extended stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that when visiting the historic city, you can stay for a few days all day, and at night you can return to the boat and sleep there.
If you go ashore only by boat excursions, you will not need a special visa (from 2009 onwards).
Some cruises in brochures mention Berlin in Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
