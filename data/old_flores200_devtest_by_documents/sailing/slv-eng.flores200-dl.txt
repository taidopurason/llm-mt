Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in lakes and in islets off the coast.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national sport, with one in seven or eight people owning a boat.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite rare (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most special Baltic cruises include an extended stopover in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means that if you visit the historic city, you can stay all day for a couple of days and return to the ship at night to spend the night.
If you only go ashore on boat excursions, you will not need a special visa (from 2009 onwards).
Some cruise brochures mention Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
