The streams support riders and hang on each side of the saddle.
The rider offers greater stability, but they can also be a problem in terms of security, as they can catch rider's legs.
If the horse throws his rider from himself and the rider's foot gets caught in strerms, the horse could pull him behind in the event of an escape.In order to reduce this risk, we can follow a series of precautions.
First, most riders carry riding boots with heel and smooth, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, they have some saddles, especially English saddles, safety latches that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it back during the fall.
