The stirrups that hang on both sides of the saddle serve as support for the rider's legs.
They give the rider more stability, but can be associated with safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but gets his foot caught in the stirrup and the horse starts to run, the rider may be pulled behind. A number of precautions can be taken to minimise this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft sole that is relatively narrow.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety skids that allow the stirrup strap to fall from the saddle when a falling rider pulls on it.
