The straps are supported by the rider's feet and hang on each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the rider, but they can also pose a safety problem, as the rider's feet can be caught in them.
If a horse throws a rider off himself and the rider's foot is caught in a stirrup, the horse could drag it behind in case of escape. To minimize this risk, a series of precautions can be considered.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and smooth, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety latches that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it back during the fall.
