The calipers that hang on both sides of the saddle serve as a support for the rider's legs.
The riders provide greater stability, but they can be associated with security problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet are stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown out of the horse, but his leg is caught in the caliper and the horse begins to run, the rider can pull behind him.A number of security measures can be taken to minimize this risk.
First, most riders wear riding shoes with heel and fine sole, which is quite narrow.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English, safety ski, allow the caliper belt to fall from the saddle when the falling rider pulls behind him.
