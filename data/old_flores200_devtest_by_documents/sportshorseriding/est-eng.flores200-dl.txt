The hanging feet on either side of the saddle are designed to support the rider's legs.
They help the rider to keep his balance better, but can be dangerous as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but his or her foot gets caught in the footrest, the horse may pull the rider off the horse and run off. Precautions should be taken to minimise this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have guards that allow the leg strap to come off the saddle if the rider pulls backwards when falling.
