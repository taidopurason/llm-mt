The legs hanging on each side of the saddle are designed to support the rider's legs.
They help the rider to keep a better balance, but can be dangerous as the rider's legs can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off the horse's back but his leg gets stuck in his foot, it may be that the horse may drag him by running away. To reduce this risk, precautions should be observed.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and smooth, rather narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially the English saddles, have guardrails that allow the footer strap to come off the saddle when a falling rider pulls it backwards.
