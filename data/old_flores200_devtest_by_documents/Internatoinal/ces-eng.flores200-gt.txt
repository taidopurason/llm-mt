Martelly swore yesterday in a nine -member interim election board (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the measures serving to move the country to new elections.
The Commission represented Martelly's response to the massive anti -government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were caused by failure to organize elections and some have been running since 2011.
