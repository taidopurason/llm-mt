Martelly swore in a new nine-member ad hoc electoral council yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission issued a recommendation for the resignation of the previous chief executive as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were prompted by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been expected since 2011.
