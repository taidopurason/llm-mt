Martelli swore yesterday in a nine -member temporary election council (CEP).
This is Martell's fifth cep in four years.
Last month, as part of a package of measures to move the state, the Presidency committee proposed to new elections to the pre -resignation of the temporary election council.
The Commission was Martell's response to the universal anti -regime protests that began in October.
Protests, which are also occasionally violent, have triggered unsuccessful elections, some of which should have happened in 2011.
