Martelly sworn in a new interim electoral council of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral College (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the President's Commission issued a recommendation for the resignation of the previous executive president as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were prompted by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been expected to take place since 2011.
