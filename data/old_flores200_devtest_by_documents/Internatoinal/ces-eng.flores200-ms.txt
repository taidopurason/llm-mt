Martelly was sworn in yesterday in the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures to move the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, and some have been ongoing since 2011.
