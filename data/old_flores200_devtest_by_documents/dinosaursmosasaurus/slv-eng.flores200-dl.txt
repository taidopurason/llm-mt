The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, and feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw contained more than 70 extremely sharp teeth, and it had extra teeth in the sky, so it could bite anything that crossed its path.
We don't have exact details, but he may have had a forked tongue. It fed on turtles, large fish and other mososaurs, and may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked all creatures that entered the water; even huge dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus were no match for it.
