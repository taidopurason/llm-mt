The mosasaurus was the supreme predator of his time, so he was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
His long jaw contained more than 70 extremely sharp teeth, and he had extra teeth in the sky, killing all that crossed his path.
We do not have accurate data, but may have had a split language. He fed on turtles, large fish and other mozosaurs, perhaps even cannibal.
He also attacked all creatures that had stepped into the water; Not even huge dinosaurs, such as tyrannosaurs, coped with it.
