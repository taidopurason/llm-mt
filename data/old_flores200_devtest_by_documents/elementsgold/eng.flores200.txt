Gold may be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wire, which can be twisted and plaited. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and stuck onto other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
