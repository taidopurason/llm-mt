Gold can be shaped into many different forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be unwound into thin wire which can be twisted and braided. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be flattened very thinly and attached to other metals. Because it can be flattened so thinly, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-paintings in books called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
