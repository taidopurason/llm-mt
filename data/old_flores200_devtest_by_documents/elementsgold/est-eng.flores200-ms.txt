Gold can be processed into all kinds of forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted or braided into a braid. It is possible to tamp it or roll it into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin and put on other metals. It can be made so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted images of books, which were called illuminated manuscripts.
