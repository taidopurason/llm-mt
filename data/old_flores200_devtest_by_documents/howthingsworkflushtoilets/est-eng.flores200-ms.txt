In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, a water closet was found in almost every house, which was connected to a complex sewage system.
The remains of sewer systems have been found in Crete, in houses in the cities of the Minos culture, and in Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public hot houses with a mix of men and women.
