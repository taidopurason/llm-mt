In the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, there was a water closet in almost every house, connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in Crete, in the houses of the Minoan cities, and in Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilisation, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women mixed.
