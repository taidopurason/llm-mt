The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of wastewater drainage systems have been found in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In ancient Rome, toilets were sometimes part of public baths frequented by men and women together.
