In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, almost every house had a flush toilet, which was connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
The remains of the sewer system were found in houses in Mino cities in Crete and Santorin in Greece.
The toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China.In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women met in mixed societies.
