Ski touring: this activity is also referred to as cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski touring.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although they are not part of this activity, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires much sturdier skis and boots.

In good conditions you can cover slightly greater distances than on foot - but you will rarely move at the speeds you would achieve on cross-country skis without a heavy pack and on a groomed track.
