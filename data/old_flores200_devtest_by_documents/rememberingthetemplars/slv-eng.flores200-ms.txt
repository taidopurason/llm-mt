In order for the Templars to understand, it is necessary to understand the context due to which they created order.
The era in which these events unfolded is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, marking the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000â€“1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages, it was the early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
