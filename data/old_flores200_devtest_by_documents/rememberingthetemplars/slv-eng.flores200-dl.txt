To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context for which they were created.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, which marks the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which are agreed to end around 1500.
