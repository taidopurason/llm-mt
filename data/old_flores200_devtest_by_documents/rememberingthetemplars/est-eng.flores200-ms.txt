To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the Order.
The era in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages and was a period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000â€“1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which, according to the agreement, is considered to be 1500.
