The marking for "arc up" looks like a V, and for "arc down" like a paperclip or a square with no underside.
Up means you should start at the top of the bow and push it in, down means you should start at the frog (i.e. where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow out.
Pulling the bow from the top usually produces a softer sound, while pulling the bow from the bottom is stronger and more assertive.
You can use a pencil to outline your bow marks if you wish, but remember that the printed bow marks are given for the sake of the music, so they should otherwise be followed.
