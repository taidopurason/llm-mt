The "bow up" label looks like a letter V and for "bow down" as a clip or square without the underside.
Up means that you should start at the top of the arch and push it down, it means that you should start at the frog (hence where you hold your bow) and pull the bow.
The pulling of the arch from above usually creates a softer sound, while the arch of the arch is stronger and more determined from below.
If you wish, you can draw your arches with a pencil, but remember that the printed arches are listed for music, so they should be considered.
