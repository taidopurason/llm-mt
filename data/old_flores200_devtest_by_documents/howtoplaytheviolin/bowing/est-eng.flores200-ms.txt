The sign "bow upright" resembles the letter V, and the sign "under the bow" on the clamp or square with the underside missing.
"''Up'' means you should start at the end and push the sheet, and ''down'' means you should start at the frog (the place where your hand holds the sheet) and pull the sheet."
The upward shtrich creates a softer sound, while the downward shtrich is stronger and more vigorous.
Feel free to write down your own symbols, but remember that printed shtriches are included there for a musical reason, and so they should be respected.
