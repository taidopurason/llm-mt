The "bow up" sign resembles a letter V and the "bow down" sign resembles a bracket or square with the bottom missing.
""'Up' means you should start at the tip and push the boom, and "'down' means you should start at the boom butt (where your hand holds the boom) and pull the boom.""
The upward štrihh creates a softer sound, while the downward štrihh is stronger and more forceful.
Feel free to write down your own indications, but remember that the printed schtrihhs are there for a musical reason and should be respected.
