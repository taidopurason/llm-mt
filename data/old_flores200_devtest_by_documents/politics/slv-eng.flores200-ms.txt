In France, elections have always been low-tech: voters hide in individual booths and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper with the choice marked in the envelope.
Once the voter has been confirmed by officials, the envelope shall be placed in the ballot box and signed on the electoral roll.
French electoral law provides for this procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there is no envelope in them at the start of the election and that no envelope other than those submitted by duly entered and authorised voters has been added.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all stages of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers count votes under strict supervision, observing certain procedures.
