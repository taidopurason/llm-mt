In France, elections have always been low-tech: voters hide in individual booths and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper with their choice marked into an envelope.
Once the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, he or she deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
French electoral law is quite strict on this procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope is inside them at the start of the poll and that no envelopes have been added other than those submitted by duly registered and authorised voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following certain procedures.
