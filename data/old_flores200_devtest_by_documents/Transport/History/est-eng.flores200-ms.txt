The first known mode of transportation was walkingâ€”Homo erectus (or upright man) began walking upright two million years ago.
To their progenitor, the Australopites, walking upright was not habitual.
Examples of specialization in two legs are found in fossils of the Australopitecus, which date back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the sahelntropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
