The first known mode of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not, as a rule, walk upright.
Bipeds are found in Australopithecine fossils between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
