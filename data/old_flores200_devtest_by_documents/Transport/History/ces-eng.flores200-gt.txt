The first known way of transport was walking, and people began to walk tightly two million years ago at Homo erectus (which means a person upright).
Their predecessor Australopithecus usually did not squeeze upright.
The two -bars occur in the fossils of the Australopites 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs seven million years ago.
