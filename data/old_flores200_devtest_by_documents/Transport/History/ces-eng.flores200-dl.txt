The first known mode of transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestor Australopithecus did not generally walk upright.
Bipeds are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
