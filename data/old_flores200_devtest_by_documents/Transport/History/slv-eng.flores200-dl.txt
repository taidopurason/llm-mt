Walking was the first known means of transport, and humans began walking upright two million years ago, when Homo erectus (or upright man) appeared.
Their ancestor, the australopithecine, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal walking features are present in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but the hominid Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
