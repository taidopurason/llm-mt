The first known mode of transport was walking - Homo erectus (or upright person) began to walk up two million years ago.
For their ancestor, the Australopics, walking up was not familiar.
Examples of specialization on two legs are found in Australopian fossils, dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropy could walk on two feet seven million years ago.
