The first known form of transport was walking - Homo erectus (or upright man) started walking upright two million years ago.
Their predecessor, australopithecus, was not used to walking upright.
Examples of bipedal specialisation can be found in fossils of australopithecus dating from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelantropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
