The first known transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus did not walk upright as habitually.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
