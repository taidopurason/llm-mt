Travelers can encounter animal pests that they do not know in their domestic regions.
Pests can spoil foods, cause hypersensitivity, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, emit poison or tolerate infections.
Infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can hurt or kill humans with force are usually not considered pests.
