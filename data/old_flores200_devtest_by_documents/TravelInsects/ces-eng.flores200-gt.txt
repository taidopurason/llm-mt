Travelers may encounter animal pests that do not know in their home regions.
Difficult insects can cause spoiling of food, skin irritation, or in worse cases of allergic reactions, poison spread or transmission of infections.
As such, infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can force or kill a person are usually not among pests.
