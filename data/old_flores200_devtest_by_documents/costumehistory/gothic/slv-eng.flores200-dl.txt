The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At the beginning, dress in the East had a strong Byzantine flavour.
However, due to slow communication links, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, and a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
