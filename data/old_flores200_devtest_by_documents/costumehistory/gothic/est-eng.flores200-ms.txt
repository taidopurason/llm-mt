The Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture inherent in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West may have lagged behind for nearly 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of that time due to the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
