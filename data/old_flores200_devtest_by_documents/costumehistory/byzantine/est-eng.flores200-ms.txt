Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its renown as a place where all luxuries were concentrated began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders had returned with such gifts as silks and spices, which were more valuable than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
