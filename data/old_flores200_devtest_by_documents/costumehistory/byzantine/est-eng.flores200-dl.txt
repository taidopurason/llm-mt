Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a place where all the luxuries were concentrated began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were more valuable than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
