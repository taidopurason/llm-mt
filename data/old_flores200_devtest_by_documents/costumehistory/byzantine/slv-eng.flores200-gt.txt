Similar to Paris today, it is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was sometimes considered to be the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation, according to which he was labeled the center of luxury, established himself around 400 n.š.and lasted up to 1100 n.š.
His status dropped a bit in the twelfth century, because the crusaders returned home full of silk -shaped gifts and spices that were worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
In the meantime, the title of fashion capital from Constantinople moved to Paris.
