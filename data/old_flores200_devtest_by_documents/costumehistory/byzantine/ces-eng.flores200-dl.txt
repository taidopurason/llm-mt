Just as Paris is known as the fashion centre of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion centre of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicentre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its importance declined during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that participants in the Crusades brought valuables such as silk and spices back to Europe, and these were worth more at home than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
