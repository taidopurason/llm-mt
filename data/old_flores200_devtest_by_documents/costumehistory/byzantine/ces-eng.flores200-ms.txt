Just as Paris is known as the fashion center of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion center of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its importance diminished during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that crusaders brought valuables, such as silk and spices, back to Europe, and these were priced at home higher than the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
