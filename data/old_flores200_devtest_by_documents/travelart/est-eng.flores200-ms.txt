There is no universal definition that determines which goods produced are antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods older than 100 years.
The definition is different in different geographic areas, for example, in places such as North America, the age limit may be shorter than in Europe.
Handmade products can be called antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass products.
