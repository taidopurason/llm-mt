There is no universal definition that determines which goods are antiques.Some tax authorities define goods as antiques over 100 years.
The definition is different in different geographical areas, for example in places such as North America may be shorter than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be called antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass products.
