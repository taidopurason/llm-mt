There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define as antiques goods more than 100 years old.
This definition has geographical variations, such as the age limit in North America being lower than in Europe.
Handmade items can be classified as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
