Horse-drawn railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although stagecoach roads were usually made up of only parallel planks, they allowed packhorses to reach greater speeds and carry heavier loads than other roads of the time, which were slightly rougher.
Sleepers were introduced fairly early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was found that tracks were more efficient if they had a strip of iron on their surface.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wagon wheels.
Eventually the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
