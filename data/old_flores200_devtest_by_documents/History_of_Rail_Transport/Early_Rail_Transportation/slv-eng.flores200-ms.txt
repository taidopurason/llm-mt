In England, rails were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks consisted solely of parallel boards, they allowed the horses they towed to reach higher speeds and tow larger loads than on slightly worse roads at the time.
Quite soon, they began to use thresholds to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, they found that tracks are more efficient when they have a strip of iron on top.
This became widespread practice, but iron made wooden wheels on wagons wear out faster.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails were introduced, which were made entirely of iron.
