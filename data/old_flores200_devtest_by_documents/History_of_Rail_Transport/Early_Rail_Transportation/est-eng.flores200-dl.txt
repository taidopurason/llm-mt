Railway lines were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagon roads consisted of nothing more than parallel planks of timber, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and haul greater quantities than the slightly bumpier roads of the time.
The use of sleepers was introduced quite early to hold the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that rails were more efficient if they had iron bars on them.
This became the standard method, but the iron wore out the wooden wheels of the wagon.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
