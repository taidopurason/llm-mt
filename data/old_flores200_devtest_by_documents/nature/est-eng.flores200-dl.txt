After the construction of the dam in 1963, the seasonal flooding, which dumped sediment into the river, stopped.
This sediment was needed to create sandbanks and beaches that were habitats for wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish have become extinct and two, including the cyprinid gilaturbon, have become endangered.
Although the water level will rise only a few feet after the flood, officials hope this will be enough to restore the sand beasts that have carved their way downstream.
No tsunami warning has been issued and, according to the Jakarta Geophysics Agency, no tsunami warning will be issued because the tremor did not meet the 6.5 magnitude requirement.
Despite there being no tsunami threat, residents were panicked and left their workplaces and homes.
