After the construction of the dam in 1963, seasonal flooding ended, which dumped sediment into the river.
This sediment was necessary for the creation of such sand mounds and beaches that served as habitats for wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish have become extinct, and two, including the humpback gilaturbon, have become endangered.
While the water level will rise by only a few feet after the flood, officials hope that will be enough to restore the sand drinks that have been explored downstream.
No tsunami warning has been issued, and no tsunami warnings will be issued according to the Jakarta Geophysical Agency because the tremor did not meet the magnitude 6.5 requirement.
Despite the fact that there was no threat of a tsunami, residents panicked and left their jobs and homes.
