After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal floods ended, which were thrown into the river.
This sediment was needed to create sandwiches and beaches that were habitats of wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish are extinct and two, including the KÃµrg-gilaturet, have become endangered.
Although the water level rises by just a few feet after the flood, officials hope that this will be enough to restore the sand drinks under the underflow.
No tsunami warning has been issued and according to the Jakarta Geophysics Agency, no tsunami warnings will be issued as the tremor did not meet the 6.5-magnitude requirement.
Despite the fact that there was no tsunami threat, the inhabitants were panicked and left their jobs and homes.
