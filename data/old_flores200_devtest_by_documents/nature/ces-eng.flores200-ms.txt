After the dam was built in 1963, seasonal flooding was stopped, which would have spread the sediment down the river.
These deposits were essential for the creation of sandbanks and beaches that served as natural habitats for wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish have become extinct, and two more, including the Arizona gila, are now endangered.
Although water levels will rise by only a few feet after the flood, officials hope this will be enough to restore eroded sands downstream.
No tsunami warning has been issued, and according to the Jakarta Geophysical Agency, none will be issued because the tremors did not reach the required intensity of 6.5 degrees.
Despite the fact that there was no threat of a tsunami, residents began to panic and leave their shops and homes.
