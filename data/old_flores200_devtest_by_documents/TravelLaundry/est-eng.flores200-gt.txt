Ironing wet clothes helps them to dry.Many hotels have a iron and ironing table that can be borrowed, even if it is not in your room.
If the iron is not available or if you do not want to wear the ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if it exists.
Be careful not to become too hot in the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or extreme cases of desertation).
