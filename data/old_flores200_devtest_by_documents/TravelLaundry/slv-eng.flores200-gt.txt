Ironing damp clothing dries them faster.Many hotels rent irons and ironing boards if they are not already present in the room itself.
If the iron is not at hand or if you do not want to wear painted socks, you can use a hair dryer if you have one.
Make sure that the goods do not warm too much (which can be reduced or even osmoda).
