Ironing wet clothes will help them dry out. Several hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be borrowed, even if it is not in your room.
If there is no iron at hand or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if any.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too hot (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
