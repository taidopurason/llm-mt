Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if one is not present in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't fancy wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow fabric to become too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorch).
