Ironing damp clothes can help him dry.Many hotels have an iron and ironing board for rent, even if it is not directly in the room.
If there is no iron or do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try to use a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to warm up too much (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
