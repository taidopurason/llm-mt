Subcultures combine individuals with similar ideas who feel that social standards do not apply to them and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age of the members, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender.
The qualities that allow the subculture to be distinguished may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a mixture of their factors.
Members of some subculture often signal their membership through the use of a special and symbolic style, which includes fashion, behavioral manors and argon.
