Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel that societal norms do not apply to them and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender.
The characteristics that allow a subculture to be distinguished may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through the use of a particular and symbolic style, which includes fashion, behavioural patterns and argot.
