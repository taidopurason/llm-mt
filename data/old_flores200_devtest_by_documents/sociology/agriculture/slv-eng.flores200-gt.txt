Self -care agriculture is a term used for agriculture to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self -sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system that used saved seeds that originate from the same organic region, combined with crop rotation or other simple technique to ensure the best possible harvest.
In the past, most farmers have dealt with self -sufficient agriculture, and this is still true in many developing countries.
