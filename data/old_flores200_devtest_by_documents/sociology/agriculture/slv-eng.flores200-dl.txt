Subsistence farming is the term used to refer to farming with the aim of producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds from the same organic region, combined with crop rotation or another simple technique to ensure the best possible harvest.
In the past, most farmers practised subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
