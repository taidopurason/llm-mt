Subsistence agriculture is agriculture performed to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system using seed native to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, which is still the case in many developing countries.
