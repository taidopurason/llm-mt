Subsistence farming is farming practiced to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system using seed native to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
