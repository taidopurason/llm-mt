One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw from several unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized for socializing due to neglect, unfortunate or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "wolf" children.Some wolf children have been imprisoned for a long time (they were usually imprisoned by their own parents), in some cases they lived abandoned because their parents refused them because of their severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children could experience serious abuse or trauma, whereupon they were abandoned or escaped.
Others are said to have been brought up by animals, while some are claimed to have lived in the wild themselves.
In complete education of inhuman animals, a wild child shows almost identical behavior (within physical possibilities) as a given caring animal, such as its fear or ignorance towards humans.
