While teaching based on projects should make learning easier and make it more interesting, the Scaffolding method is a step further.
The skeleton is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that provides support to those individuals who undergo new practice, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding, but as well as a small staple in Microsoft Office.
The software includes virtual construction intended for analyzing, motivating and explaining procedures that could be too demanding for the student.
