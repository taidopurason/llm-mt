Children are placed in children's homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and nurturing, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system represents a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable medical care.
Foster care should provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
