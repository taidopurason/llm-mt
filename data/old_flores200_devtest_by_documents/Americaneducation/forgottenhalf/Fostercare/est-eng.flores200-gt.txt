Children are taken to an orphanage for a number of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not preservative, caring and educational, but it happens.
We believe that the system of foster families represents a security zone for these children.
The purpose of our foster family system is to provide safe homes, loving carers, stable education and reliable medical care.
The foster family should ensure all the needs that were absent from where they were taken away.
