If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original of the Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known with certainty, it is clear that the large parchment document (dimensions 293/4 x 241/2 inches) was rolled up and stored not long after its creation.
It is therefore likely that the entry was added simply as an add-on.
