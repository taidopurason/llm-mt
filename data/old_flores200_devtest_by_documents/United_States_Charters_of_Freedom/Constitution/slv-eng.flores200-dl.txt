During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states, with confederation clauses, first formed a weak central government - consisting only of Congress.
Congress had no power to enforce the duties, and in the absence of a national executive or judiciary, it relied on state governments, often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
Moreover, it had no power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The consent of all states was required to amend the Articles, but individual states did not take the central authority seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
