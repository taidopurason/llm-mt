During the American War of Independence, thirteen colonies, under the Confederate Statute, first formed a weak central government, of which Congress was the only part.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and because there was no state executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, who were often not very cooperative, to enact all legislation.
Nor did it have the authority to repeal tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be changed, and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
