During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states with provisions on the Confederation first formed a weak central government â€“ consisting only of Congress.
Congress did not have the power to enforce duties, but since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which often refused to cooperate, to enforce its laws.
In addition, he had no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between countries.
To supplement the articles, unanimity of all federal states was required, but the central authorities were not taken seriously by individual states, so their representatives were often absent.
