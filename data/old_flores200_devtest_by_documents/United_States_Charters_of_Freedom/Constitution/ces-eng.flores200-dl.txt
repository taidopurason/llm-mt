During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only branch, falling under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state governments, which often did not cooperate, to enforce laws.
It also had no power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all states before they could be added. The states took the central government lightly, so much so that their representatives were often absent.
