During the war for the independence of the thirteen states, first formed a weak central government, when Congress was its only component falling under the articles of the Confederation.
The Congress came to the imposition of taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial body, he relied on state authorities that often did not cooperate.
Also, there was no authority to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all states before they could be supplemented.The states took the central government lightly, so much that their representatives were often not present.
