During the revolutionary war, thirteen countries, with the provisions on the confederation, first formed a weak central government - composed only by Congress.
Congress had no power to claim benefits, but since there was no national executive or judicial authority, he relied on state authorities for the implementation of his laws, which often did not want to participate.
In addition, he had no powers to annul tax laws and tariff between countries.
The consent of all states was required to supplement the articles, but individual federal countries did not seriously take the central authorities, so their representatives were often absent.
