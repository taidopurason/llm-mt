During the American War of Independence, thirteen colonies formed a weak central government first under the Statute of the Confederation, the only part of which was the Congress.
The congress did not have the power to establish taxes, and because of the lack of state enforcement or judicial power, it was based on the establishment of all legislation on the states, which were often not very cooperative.
He also did not have the authority to cancel tax laws and inter -state tariffs.
The articles demanded unanimous consent from all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
