Traditionally, Easter should be spent in an exposed spot to wait for the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may also be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often held on Saturday night during Easter weekend, where the gathering often turns into a celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
