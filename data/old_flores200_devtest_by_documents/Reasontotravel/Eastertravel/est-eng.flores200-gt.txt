It is a tradition to spend Easter night in some open places to see sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it can also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The most traditional churches often have Easter memorials on Saturday night on Saturday night, with churches often at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
