It's a tradition to spend Easter night awake in an open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may also be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter services on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, with congregations often partying at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
