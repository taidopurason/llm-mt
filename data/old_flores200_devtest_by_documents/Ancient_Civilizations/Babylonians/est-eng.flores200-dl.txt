The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People made offerings to the gods, and priests tended to their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only priests can enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called tsikuraats were built as part of the temples.
The tower was a special shrine to the god.
