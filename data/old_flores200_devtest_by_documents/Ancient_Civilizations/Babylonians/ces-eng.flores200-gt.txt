The Babylonians built a temple who was considered his home to each of their gods.
People brought victims to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then the inner shrine, where they could only enter the priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, a special towers of the pyramid shape were built called zikkuraty.
The highlight of the tower was a special shrine designed for God.
