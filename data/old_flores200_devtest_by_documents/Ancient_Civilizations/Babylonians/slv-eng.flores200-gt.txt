The Babylonians built each God the main temple, which is supposed to represent the home of an individual God.
People brought victims to the gods, and priests tried to quench the needs of the gods with rituals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner shrine, into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid towers, which are called zigurati and were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special refuge for God.
