Greenland was sparsely populated. According to the ancient Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red was sent into exile from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled farther west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
Despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
