Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it the Green Land.
Notwithstanding his discovery, there were already tribes of Eskimos living there.
Although all countries were part of "Scandinavia", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
