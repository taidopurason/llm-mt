Greenland was rarely populated.The Nordic saga is said to have been expelled from Iceland due to the murder of Erik and that he discovered Greenland in his path to the west and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery, the tribes of Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between their people, kings, customs and history.
