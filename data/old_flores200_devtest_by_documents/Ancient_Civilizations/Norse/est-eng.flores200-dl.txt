Greenland was sparsely populated. According to ancient Scandinavian legends, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west he discovered Greenland and named it.
Despite his discovery, the area was already inhabited by prehistoric tribes.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
