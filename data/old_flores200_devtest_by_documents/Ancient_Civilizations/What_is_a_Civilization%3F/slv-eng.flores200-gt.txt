Civilization is a unique culture that is a common large group of individuals who live and participate, society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilians, which means civic and is related to the Latin word Civis, which means a citizen, and civitas, which means a city or urban state, which in some way also characterizes the size of society.
City countries are the precursors of nations.The culture of civilization involves giving knowledge through the generations, a permanent cultural trace and significant prevalence.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving important historical traces behind them, so they cannot be considered as true civilization.
