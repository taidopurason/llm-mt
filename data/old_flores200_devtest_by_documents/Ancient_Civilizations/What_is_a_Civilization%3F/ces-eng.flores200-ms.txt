Civilization is a certain culture, common to a significant large group of people who live and work in cooperation with each other, i.e. together they form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis" which means "civil" and is related to the Latin "civis" which means "citizen" and also "civitas", which means city or city-state, and at the same time it defines the greatness of society in a certain way.
The ancestors of nations were city-states. The culture of civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces and adequate dissemination.
Small-scale cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
