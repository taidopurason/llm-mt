Excursions are an important part of each lesson.Teachers would often be happy to take students to places that cannot be taken by bus.
Technology offers solutions by implementing virtual excursions.Students can see museum artifacts, visit aquariums or admire art in the classroom.
Publishing a report on an online excursion is also an excellent way of thinking about a trip and sharing experience with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina are shaping a website every year about their trip to the country's capital, transforming the site every year, but old versions remain online and serve as a memorial album.
