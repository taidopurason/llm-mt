Field trips are an essential part of every course. The teacher would often like to take her students to places where a bus trip is out of the question.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual field trips. Students can look at artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Virtual field trip sharing is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, each year, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a web page about their trip to the state capital. Each year they redesign the site, but the old versions remain online and serve as an album.
