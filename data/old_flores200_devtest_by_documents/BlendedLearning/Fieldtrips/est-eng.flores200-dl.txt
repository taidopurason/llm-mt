Excursions are a big part of every class. Often, a teacher would like to take students to places they can't go by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Sitting in class, students can look at museum artefacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art.
Sharing a tour virtually is also a great way to reflect on one trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. Each year, the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept as a reminder.
