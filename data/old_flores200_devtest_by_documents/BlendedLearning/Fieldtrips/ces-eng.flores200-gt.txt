The excursion is a substantial part of each subject.The teacher would often like to take her students to places where the bus journey is out of the question.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual excursions.Students can look at artifacts from the museum, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual sharing excursions is also a great way to think about a trip and share experience with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website every year about their trip to the capital of the state.Every year they rework the pages, but the old versions remain online and serve as an album.
