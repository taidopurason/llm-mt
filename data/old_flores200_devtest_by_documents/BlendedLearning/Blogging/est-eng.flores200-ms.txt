Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. At the same time, when students often begin their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve his writing skills to avoid criticism.
"Also, ''blogging forces students to feel better about the world around them.'" Capturing readers' attention encourages students to be cunning and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that provides inspiration for collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond a traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical; By actively responding to online materials, students can determine their position on other people's writings, as well as provide insight into their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
