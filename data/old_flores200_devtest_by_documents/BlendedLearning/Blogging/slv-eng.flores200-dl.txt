Weblogs can help students improve their writing style. Although most students start a blog with sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
As students can often be the most demanding audience, the blog writer starts to try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to capture the interest of the audience inspires students to want to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Keeping a blog is a tool that encourages students' engagement and effort to learn even when they are not in school.
The appropriate use of weblogs "can encourage students to think more analytically and critically; by constantly responding to online material, students can position themselves in relation to the writings of others and form their own views on particular topics (Oravec, 2002).
