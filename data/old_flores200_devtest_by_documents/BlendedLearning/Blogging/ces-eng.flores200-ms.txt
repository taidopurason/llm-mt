Even blogs can improve students' writing skills. Although their blogging in the beginning is often marked by sloppy spelling, the influence of other readers usually changes this.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blog writer tries to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to have an overview of the world around them." The need to stimulate audience interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend education beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "will allow students to improve their analytical and critical skills; By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other texts and formulate their point of view on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
