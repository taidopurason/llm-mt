Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. However, while students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve writing skills to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also 'forces students to become more aware of the world around them'." Catching readers' attention encourages students to be crafty and engaging (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can help students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, students can determine where they stand in relation to other people's writings and provide insight into their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
