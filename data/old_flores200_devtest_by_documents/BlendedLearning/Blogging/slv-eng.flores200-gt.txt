Stronglets can help students improve their style of writing.Although most students start writing a blog with superficial grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of the audience.
Because students can often be the most demanding audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, writing blogs "forces students to be better aware of the world around them."The need to attract the interest of the audience is inspired by the students that they want to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Keeping a blog is a tool that encourages students' cooperation and efforts to learn, even when they are not at school.
Proper use of blogs "can encourage students to more analytical and critical thinking; by constantly responding to online material, students can determine their position according to the records of others and form their view of certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
