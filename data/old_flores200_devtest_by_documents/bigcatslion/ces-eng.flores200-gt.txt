Lions are the most special cats, they live in large groups called packs.
The pack consists of one to three relatives of adult males along with up to thirty females and chicks.
Females are usually closely related and represent a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
The lion pack behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to the lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
