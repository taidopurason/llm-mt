The lions are the most social cats and live in large groups we call a herd.
There are one to three males related in the herd and up to thirty females and puppies.
As a large family of sisters and daughters, women are usually closely linked to each other.
The lion's herd behaves very much like a lump of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to the lions (but not other big cats) and also very deadly for their prey.
