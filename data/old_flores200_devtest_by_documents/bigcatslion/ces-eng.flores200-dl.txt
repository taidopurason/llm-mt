Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three related adult males along with up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related and are a large family made up of sisters and daughters.
A lion pride behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
