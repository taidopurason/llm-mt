This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make your own indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes colour depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H stands for hydrogen in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons stripped from them (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
