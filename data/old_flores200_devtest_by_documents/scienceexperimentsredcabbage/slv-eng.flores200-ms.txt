This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator already with the juice of red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH of the chemicals tested is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons taken from them by electrons (namely, hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
