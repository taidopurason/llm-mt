This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator yourself using the juice of red cabbage.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (letter H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons taken away (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
