Pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
You should pay attention primarily to the letters c and g, since their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel followed by them.
Also, try to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means expensive, while carro means chariot.
