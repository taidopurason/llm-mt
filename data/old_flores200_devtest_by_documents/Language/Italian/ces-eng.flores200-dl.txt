In Italian, pronunciation is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are C and G, as their pronunciation varies according to the vowel that follows them.
Also beware of the different pronunciation of the r and rr: "caro" means "dear", while "carro" means "carriage".
