Pronunciation in Italian is fairly easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the next vowel.
"Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means 'expensive', but carro means 'arch'."
