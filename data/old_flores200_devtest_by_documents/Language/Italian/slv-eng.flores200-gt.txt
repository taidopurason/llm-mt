The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
You must pay particular attention to the letter C and G, as their pronunciation differs depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, do your best to say R and RR differently: Caro means darling while Carro means a cart.
