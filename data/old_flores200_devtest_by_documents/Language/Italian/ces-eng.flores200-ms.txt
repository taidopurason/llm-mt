In Italian, the pronunciation is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are C and G, as their pronunciation varies according to the vowel that follows them.
Also beware of the different pronunciations of the r and rr sounds: "caro" means "expensive", while "carro" means "chariot".
