All nouns together with the word SIE (you) are always written with a capital letter at the beginning, and even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It is also easier to read, although writing is somewhat complicated to find out whether the verb or the adjective is used in noun form.
