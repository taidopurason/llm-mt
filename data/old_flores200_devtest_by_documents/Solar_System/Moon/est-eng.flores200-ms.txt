The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km thick at the front and 100 km thick at the back.
It is thinner under the moon seas and thicker under the highlands.
On the closer side there may be more seas, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
