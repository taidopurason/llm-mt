The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the front and 100 km thick at the back.
It is thinner beneath the lunar highlands and thicker beneath the lowlands.
There may be more oceans on the nearer side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to surface.
