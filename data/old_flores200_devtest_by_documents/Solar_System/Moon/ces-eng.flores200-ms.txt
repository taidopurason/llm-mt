The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called a crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is weaker under the sea and stronger under the mountains.
There may be more lunar seas on the nearer side because the crust is thinner. This made it easier for the lava to reach the surface.
