The surface of the Moon consists of stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
On the near side, the crust is about 70 km thick, and on the far - 100 km.
Under the seas, it is thinner, and under the highlands it is thicker.
More seas could be on the closer side, as the crust is thinner. Lava more easily rose to the surface.
