A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
