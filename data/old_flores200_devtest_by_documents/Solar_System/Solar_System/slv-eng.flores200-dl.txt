Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the Sun (and even the other stars), revolves around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, since we don't feel that the Earth is moving, do we?
