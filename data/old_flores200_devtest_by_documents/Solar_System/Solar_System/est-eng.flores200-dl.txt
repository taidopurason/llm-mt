Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite - that the solar system, along with the Sun (and even other stars), moved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, because the Earth is not felt to be moving, is it?
