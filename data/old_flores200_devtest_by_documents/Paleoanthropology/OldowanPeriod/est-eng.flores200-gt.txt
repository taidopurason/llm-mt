In the savannah, a primable that has a human digestive system is difficult to meet the needs of their amino acids with the help of the plants available.
Moreover, if it cannot be done, it has serious consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition and finally death.
The most easily available vegetable sources would have been proteins in leaf and vegetables, but for our primates, they are easy to digest only.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all the necessary amino acids.
With all this in mind, we should not be surprised that our own predecessors solved their protein problem in about the same way as chimpanzees today in Savanna.
