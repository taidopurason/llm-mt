A primate with a digestive system similar to a human, with plant resources available in the savannah, has difficulty meeting its amino acid needs.
Moreover, if this need cannot be met, serious consequences result: stunting, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the proteins present in leaves and legumes, which are, however, difficult for primates, of which we are one, to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also a source of high quality protein containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
