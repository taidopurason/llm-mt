For primates with a human -like digestive system, it is difficult to satisfy the need for amino acids from plant sources available in an open savannah.
In addition, if they do not, it has serious consequences: growth of depression, malnutrition and eventually death.
Proteins would be available in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for our primates if they are not cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a high amount of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved the protein problem just as chimpanzees in the savannah today do.
