For primates with a human-like digestive system, it is difficult to meet the need for amino acids from plant sources available in the open savannah.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: the growth of depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us as primates to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high amounts of protein that contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved the protein problem much like chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
