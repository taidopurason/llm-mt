Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological efforts or technological need to the idea of driven by the fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have the same general idea: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology, consequently, causes "effects" to companies that are previously inherent than socially conditioned.
For example, we could say that roads will surely develop with the development of the car.
However, the national road network cannot be economically justified for just a few cars, so new methods of manufacturing are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in health care for the care of damaged bodies.
