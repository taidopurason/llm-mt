Technological determinism is a concept that, in practice, encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological driving force or technological imperative to the firm belief that human destiny is governed by the logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a trajectory that is largely culturally or politically influenced, and that technology itself exerts effects on society that are intrinsic rather than socially determined.
For example, it could be said that the existence of motor vehicles certainly necessitates the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, and so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques for repairing damaged bodies in the health sector.
