Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological endeavor or technological need to the idea that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their implementation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share the same general idea: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology in turn produces "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that with the development of the car, roads will certainly also develop.
However, the national road network cannot be economically justified for only a few cars, so new ways of manufacturing are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increased incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for injured bodies.
