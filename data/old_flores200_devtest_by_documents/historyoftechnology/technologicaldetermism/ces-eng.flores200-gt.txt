Technological determinism is a term that includes a wide range of ideas in practice: for example, so -called PUSCH technology or technological imperative, or belief that human destiny is controlled by all -pervading logic together with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology is followed by a way that greatly exceeds cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has an "influence" on societies that are inherent than socially conditional society.
For example, we can say that when motor cars appear, it will necessarily lead to road development.
But the nationwide road network is not economically viable for mere a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in cases of road accidents, causing inventing new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
