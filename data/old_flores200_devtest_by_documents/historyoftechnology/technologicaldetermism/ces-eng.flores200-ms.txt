Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technology pusch or technological imperative, or the belief that human fate is governed by all-pervading logic, along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has an "influence" on societies that are inherent rather than on socially conditioned societies.
We can say, for example, that when motor cars appear, this will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
But the nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is also leading to an increase in road accidents, causing new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
