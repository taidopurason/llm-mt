Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives to this day. We call them birds.
Many people do not perceive them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
All the same, birds share many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs and walk on their hind two legs like tyrannosaurs.
