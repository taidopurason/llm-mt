Many modern palaeontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to the present day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds have several other features that look dinosaur-like.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
