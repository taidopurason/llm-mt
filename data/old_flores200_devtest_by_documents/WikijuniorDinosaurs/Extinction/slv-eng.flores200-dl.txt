Today, many palaeontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds share many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs and walk on their back two legs like tyrannosaurs.
