Widespread looting reportedly continued overnight, as law enforcement officers were not present on Bishkek's streets.
Bishkek was described as sinking into a state of "anarchy" by one observer, as gangs of people roamed the streets and plundered stores of consumer goods.
Several Bishkek residents blamed protesters from the south for the lawlessness.
