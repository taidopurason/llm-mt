Widespread looting reportedly continued overnight, as police officers were not present on the streets of Bishkek.
Bishkek was described by one observer as sinking into a state of "anarchy." Gangs of people roamed the streets, looting consumer goods stores.
Several Bishkek residents accused protesters from the south of illegal conduct.
