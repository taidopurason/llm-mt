The massive looting reportedly continued throughout the night as there were no law enforcement officers on the streets of Bishkek.
According to one onlooker, anarchy seemed to have broken out in Bishkek, with human gangs roaming the streets and looting shops for consumer goods.
Several Bishkek residents accused the protesters from the south of anarchy.
