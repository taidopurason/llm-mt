The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continuing relationships” were also identified as new motivation aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
