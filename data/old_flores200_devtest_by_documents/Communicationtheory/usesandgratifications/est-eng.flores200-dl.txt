The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and person-to-person communication.
The specificities of the Internet bring additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are identified as important drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' as new motivational aspects when they studied audience responses to websites.
