The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of facial movements or micro-expressions lasting only a few milliseconds.

Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", pointed out that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately recognize sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities for interpreting human behavior are also present in animals, for example, domesticated dogs.
