Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for many Saami, and the culture associated with the trade is also important for many other professions.
But even traditionally, not all Sámi practised extensive reindeer husbandry, but rather made a living from fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer mainly as draught animals.
Today, many Sámi work in the modern trade. In the Saami region of Lapland, tourism is an important source of income.
