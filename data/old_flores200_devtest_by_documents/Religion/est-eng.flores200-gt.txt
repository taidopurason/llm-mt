More than four million people went to Rome to attend the funeral.
The number of people on the spot was so high that not everyone could access the funeral of St. Peter's Square.
Several large TV screens were put up in many parts of Rome to watch the ceremony.
In many other Italian cities and elsewhere in the world, especially in Poland, things were set up and looked at a large number of people.
