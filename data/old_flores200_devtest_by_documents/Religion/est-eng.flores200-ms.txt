More than four million people went to Rome to attend the funeral.
The number of people on the ground was so large that not everyone was able to access the funeral in St. Peter's Square.
So that the crowd could watch the ceremony, several large television screens were put up in several parts of Rome.
In many other Italian cities and in other parts of the world, especially in Poland, things were set up in a similar way and were watched by a large number of people.
