More than four million people went to Rome for the funeral.
The number of people present was so large that it was impossible for everyone to attend the funeral in St. Peter's Square.
Large television screens were placed in various places in Rome so that people could watch the ceremony.
In many other cities in Italy and the rest of the world, especially in Poland, similar screenings were held and watched by large numbers of people.
