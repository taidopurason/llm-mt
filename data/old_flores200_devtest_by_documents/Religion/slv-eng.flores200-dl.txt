More than four million people attended the funeral in Rome.
So many people were present that it was impossible to give everyone access to the funeral in St Peter's Square.
Several large television screens were set up at various locations around Rome to allow people to follow the ceremony.
Similar installations, which were seen by large numbers of people, were set up in many other Italian cities and in other parts of the world, especially in Poland.
