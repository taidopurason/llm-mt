More than four million people went to Rome.
The number of people present was so great that it was not possible for everyone to reach the funeral on St. Peter's Square.
In various places in Rome, large television screens were placed so that people could watch the ceremony.
In many other cities in Italy and the rest of the world, especially in Poland, there were similar screenings that a large number of people looked at.
