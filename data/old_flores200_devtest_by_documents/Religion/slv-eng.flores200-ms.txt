More than four million people attended the funeral in Rome.
So many people were present that it was by no means possible for everyone to be guaranteed access to the funeral in St. Peter's Square.
To help people follow the ceremony, several large television screens were set up in various places around Rome.
Similar installations, which were viewed by many people, have also been taken care of in many other Italian cities and around the world, especially Poland.
