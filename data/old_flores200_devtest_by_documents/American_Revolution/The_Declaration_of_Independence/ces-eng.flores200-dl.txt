After passage by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printer.
Something between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight, which are now called "Dunlap's prints."
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The earliest known surviving copies of the document are the so-called Dunlap broadsides, or a total of 25 copies from Dunlap's press. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
