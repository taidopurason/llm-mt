After its passage by Congress on July 4, the manuscript of the bill, signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the John Dunlap Printing House a few blocks away.
During the course of the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap copies.
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8 at the Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 copies made by Dunlap are the oldest surviving copies of the Declaration. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
