After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a hand -written draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, sent a few streets away to John Dunlap.
At night, they produced between 150 and 200 copies known as "Dunlap leaflets".
The document was first read by John Nixon on July 8 in the Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read on July 9 to his troops in New York.One copy was reached by London on August 10.
There are still 25 Dunlap leaflets that are considered to be the oldest preserved copies of this document, since the handwritten original has not been preserved.
