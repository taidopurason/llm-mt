Observation of cherry blossoms, called hanam, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea originated in China, where plum flowers were the selected flowers.
The first cherry blossom parties were hosted in Japan by the emperor and were intended only for him and other aristocrats of the emperor's court.
