Cherry blossom watching, or hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where Japanese apricots were the most common choice of flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the Emperor, for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the Imperial Court.
