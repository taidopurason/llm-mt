Singapore is generally a very safe city and you can easily orientate yourself in it, and upon arrival you can buy almost anything.
In the "hot tropical belt", just a few degrees north of the equator, however, you will have to face heat (constantly) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which happens rarely).
