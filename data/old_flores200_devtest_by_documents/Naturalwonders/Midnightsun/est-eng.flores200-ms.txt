If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar nightfall, which means that the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is dark almost around the clock.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and thus the problem of light pollution rarely occurs in their case, it is also possible to enjoy the stars there.
