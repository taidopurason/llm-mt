If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This will give you a good chance to see the Northern Lights, as it is dark more or less all day during this period.
As the areas are sparsely populated and there are mostly no problems with light pollution, you will also be able to admire the stars.
