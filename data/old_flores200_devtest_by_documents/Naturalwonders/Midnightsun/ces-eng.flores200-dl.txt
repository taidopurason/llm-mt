If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to observe the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less all the time.
As these areas are only sparsely populated and light pollution is not usually a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the view of the stars.
