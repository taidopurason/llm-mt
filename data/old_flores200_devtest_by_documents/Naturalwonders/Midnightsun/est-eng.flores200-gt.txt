When you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in the winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This gives you a good opportunity to see the northern lights as the sky is dark around the clock.
Because these areas are sparsely populated and thus rarely occur in the light pollution problem, it is also possible to enjoy the stars.
