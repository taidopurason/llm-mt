If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see Northern Lights, as the sky is dark almost all day.
As these areas are sparsely populated and therefore rarely have light pollution problems, it is also possible to enjoy the stars.
