All the animals that arrived on the islands first swam, flew or sailed here.
Because of their great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
