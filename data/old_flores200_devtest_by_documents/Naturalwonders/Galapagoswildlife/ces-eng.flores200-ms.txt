All the animals that originally arrived on the islands swam there, arrived or were carried there by wind or sea currents.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to cover this distance, and the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos Islands, a number of mammals have been brought including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
