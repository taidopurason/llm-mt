Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants prepare food for themselves from the sun with the help of photosynthesis. They also give shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are from plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
