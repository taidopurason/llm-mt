Plants create oxygen that people breathe and accept carbon dioxide, which people squeeze out of their lungs (or exhale).
Through photosynthesis, plants produce food with the help of the sun. They also offer shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Animals could not survive without plants.
