Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature at the Swedish Academy, publicly announced on Monday via a radio show on Swedish Sveriges Radio that after a futile attempt to contact Bob Dylan directly after his Nobel Prize for Literature won in 2016, the commission is abandoning its efforts to contact him.
Danius said, "We're not doing anything right now. I called and emailed his closest co-worker and received very friendly replies. It's enough for now."
