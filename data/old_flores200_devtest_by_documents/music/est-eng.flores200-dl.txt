On Monday, Sara Danius, Permanent Secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature at the Swedish Academy of Sciences, announced on Sveriges Radio's public radio programme that since Bob Dylan could not be contacted to announce his Nobel Prize for Literature 2016, the Swedish Committee has ceased its efforts to contact him.
Danius said: "At the moment we are doing nothing. We called and wrote to his closest contact and received very friendly replies. For the time being, this is certainly enough."
