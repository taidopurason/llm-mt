On Monday, Sara Danius, a permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Academy, announced in a public radio broadcast of Sveriges Radio that since Bob Dylan did not contact him to announce the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature, the Swedish Committee has completed his efforts to contact him.
Danius said, “We do nothing right now.We called and wrote to his closest partner and received very friendly answers.That is definitely enough for now. ”
