Sara Danius, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee for Literature, publicly announced on Monday during a radio show on Sveriges Radio that the committee, which was unable to directly inform Bob Dylan that he had won the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature, had abandoned its efforts to find him.
Danius said. I have called his closest collaborator and sent several emails, and have received very kind replies. For now, that is certainly enough".
