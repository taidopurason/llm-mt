About 3 minutes after the space shuttle lift-off, the on-board camera showed that several pieces of insulating material had come loose from the fuel tank.
However, they are not believed to have damaged the shuttle.
NASA's space shuttle programme manager N. Wayne Hale Jr. said the insulation foam had fallen "after a time that would concern us".
