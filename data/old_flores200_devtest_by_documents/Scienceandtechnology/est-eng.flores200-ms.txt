About 3 minutes after the space shuttle took off, the on-board camera showed that several pieces of insulating material had come off the fuel tank.
However, it is believed that they have not damaged the shuttle.
N. Wayne Hale Jr., head of NASA's space shuttle program, said the insulation foam had fallen "after a time that would worry us."
