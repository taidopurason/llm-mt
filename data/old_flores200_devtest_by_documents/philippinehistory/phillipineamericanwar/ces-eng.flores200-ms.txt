The war costs of US imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to pay a large part of the expenses, with interest on the bonds flowing in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses on Wall Street.
The extra surplus value drawn from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would, of course, constitute the basic proceeds of US imperialism.
