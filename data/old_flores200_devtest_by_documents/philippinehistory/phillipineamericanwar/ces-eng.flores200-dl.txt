The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States in order to cover a large part of the expenses, with the interest on the bonds flowing in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses on Wall Street.
The extra surplus value drawn from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would, of course, represent the basic proceeds of U.S. imperialism.
