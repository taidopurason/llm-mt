The war spendings of U.S. imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the United States to bear the cost on behalf of the Philippine government for expenses passing through Wall Street banking institutions and interest on bonds.
Of course, the super-profits earned from the long-term exploitation of the Philippine people accounted for the elementary profits of U.S. imperialism.
