The military costs of US imperialism's invasion of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to defray the cost of the expenses and interest on the bonds that passed through Wall Street banking institutions on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the elementary profits of US imperialism.
