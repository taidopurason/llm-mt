Both cyanuric acid and melamine have been found in urine samples from pets that died after eating poisoned food.
The compounds react with each other to form crystals that can interfere with normal kidney function, say the university researchers.
The researchers noticed that adding melamine and cyanuric acid to the crystals formed in the cat's urine.
When compared with infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the composition of these crystals matched those found in the urine of affected pets.
