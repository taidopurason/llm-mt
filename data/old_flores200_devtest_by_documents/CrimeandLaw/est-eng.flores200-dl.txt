Three more bombs exploded in the vicinity of government buildings within two hours.
According to some reports, the official death toll is eight, and official figures confirm that nearly 30 people were injured, but final figures are not yet known.
Both cyanuric acid and melamine were found in urine samples from pets that died after eating contaminated animal feed.
The two compounds react with each other to form crystals that can interfere with the functioning of the kidneys, the university researchers said.
The researchers observed that crystals formed in the cat's urine when melamine and cyanuric acid were added.
The composition of these crystals matched those found in the urine of affected pets when compared by infrared spectroscopy.
