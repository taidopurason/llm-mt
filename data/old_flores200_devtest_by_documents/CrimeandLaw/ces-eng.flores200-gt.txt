In samples of pets that died after consuming contaminated feed, cyanuric acid and melamine were found.
Researchers at the University said these two compounds respond to each other and form crystals that can block kidney function.

The composition of these crystals after comparison using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) corresponds to those found in the urine of affected pets.
