Red tide is caused by unusually high concentrations of Karenia brevis, a naturally occurring marine single-celled organism.
The confluence of natural factors can create ideal conditions that allow algae numbers to increase dramatically.
These algae produce a neurotoxin that can numb the nerves of both humans and fish.
High concentrations of this poison in the waters often cause fish kills.
Humans can be affected by inhaling contaminated water carried into the air by winds and waves.
At its peak, winds from Tropical Cyclone Gonu, named after a bag of palm fronds in the Maldivian language, reached speeds of up to 240 kilometres per hour (149 miles per hour).
This morning, winds were around 83 km/h and were expected to weaken further.
When the moon broke and was tossed into a breakwater by strong winds and waves, it had 120-160 cubic metres of fuel on board.
Twelve crew members were rescued by helicopters and, apart from a broken nose, there were no other injuries.
The 100-metre long ship was on its way to take on a normal load of fertiliser and the authorities were initially worried that the vessel might spill its cargo.
