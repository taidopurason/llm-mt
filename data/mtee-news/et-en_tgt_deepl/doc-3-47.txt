Singer Jessie J lost a child: I have no control over my emotions
The famous musician recently split from her lover, Max Pham, but decided to carry and raise their child as a single mother.
Unfortunately, however, doctors were unable to detect the baby's heartbeat during a recent check-up, Jessie J revealed in an Instagram post.
"Yesterday morning I was laughing with a friend, asking him: "Seriously also, how am I going to make it to tomorrow night's performance in LA without telling the entire audience that I'm pregnant?" the singer wrote.
"By lunchtime, I was struggling with how I was going to manage the performance without collapsing.
At my third antenatal check-up, I was told that the baby's heart was no longer beating.
This morning.
I feel like I have no control over my emotions.
I may regret making this post later.
I really don't know either."
Despite being in a deep mourning at the moment, she is determined to make the Los Angeles performance, believing it will help her.
"I want to sing tonight.
Not because I'm avoiding mourning or the whole process, but because I know that singing tonight will help me," she said.
"I've only done two concerts in two years and my soul needs it.
Today more than ever.
I know some people will say I should drop it, but one thing is clear to me at the moment.
I started singing when I was young because it makes me happy, it fills my soul and it's therapeutic.
That hasn't changed and that's the way I have to live things."
Jessie J revealed that she decided to raise the baby alone because she was looking forward to becoming a mother.
She knows that life is short and that getting pregnant was a miracle and an experience she will never forget.
She hopes to get pregnant again in the future, but for now she is still in shock and extremely sad.
"But I know I'm strong and I know it's going to be OK," she added.
"I also know that millions of women around the world have felt this pain and worse."
