European Medicines Agency green light: Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine is suitable for children 5-11 years old
The European Medicines Agency on Thursday recommended extending the marketing authorisation for the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine Comirnaty to children aged 5-11 years.
Until now, the vaccine was allowed for 12 years and older.
The dose of Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for children aged 5-11 years is three times lower than the usual dose (10 µg compared to 30 µg).
As in the older age group, children are given the vaccine in two injections three weeks apart.
A clinical study of 2,000 children showed that 5-11 year olds had the same immune responses at three times the dose as older age groups at full dose.
Side effects were similar to those in the older age group and were mild to moderate, resolving within a few days.
Therefore, the European Medicines Agency concluded that the benefits of the vaccine in children aged 5-11 years outweigh the risks.
The Agency will now send the recommendation to the European Commission, which will take the final decision on the use of the vaccine.
Marje Oona, a member of the national expert committee on immunoprophylaxis, told ERR that the committee will probably make a decision on the issue next week.
"Since the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval is in place, we know that the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval has been in place for some time.
The United States Immunization Committee has been recommending this for quite some time now, and with over three million children already vaccinated in the United States, I don't really see any reason why it shouldn't be given.
But we haven't discussed it yet," commented Dr Oona.
