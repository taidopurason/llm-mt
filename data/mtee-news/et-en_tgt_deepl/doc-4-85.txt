A mad dash for green or just a fool in a cocoon: toilets and bins disappear from the side of national roads
Yet another example of the evil of austerity comes from the Department for Transport, which runs counter to the green thinking we are so widely adopting.
As the transport authority has to cut operating costs by more than €3.5 million in the coming year, one of the savings identified was the removal of toilets and bins from car parks.
The decision was made on the basis that by cutting these costs, road safety will suffer the least, Raido Randmaa, director of the Transport Administration's infrastructure management service, told ERR.
There are toilets belonging to the Transport Board in 61 car parks across Estonia, and waste containers in 63 car parks.
The Agency spends €472 000 a year on toilets and €267 000 on bins.
According to Mr Randmaa, the decision has already been taken by the transport authority, but as the authority's budget has not yet been finalised, the decision has not been signed.
"Well, heaven help me - as a former Circle K manager and today the CEO of Ragn-Sells, I can't stay silent," says Kai Realo, a senior executive, on social media.
"When Circle K wanted to build service stations along new roads, where, as we all know, there are garbage bins and toilets, the biggest difficulty was to find locations where the then Road Administration would have given normal loading and unloading routes, because "Estonia is so small that a person can drive all over the country at once from edge to edge and not need to refuel, eat or go to the toilet on the way".".
Realo adds that such an attitude was unacceptable at the time, but now the decision is mind-boggling: "Can you imagine this 'land of pissing men' and these piles of rubbish in the woods?"
