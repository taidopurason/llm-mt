HINA MEDITATION RECOMMENDS: this plant should now be in every home!
In autumn, when it's crisp and damp outside, you need to strengthen and warm up.
A number of herbs are suitable for this purpose, as they keep the heat in but don't allow excessive heat to build up.
It's very convenient to put both herbs and hot water in a thermos, take it to work or school and drink a tea that supports the body throughout the day, suggests the Health Alchemy blog.
When the tea runs out, boiling water can be added to the plants several times.
