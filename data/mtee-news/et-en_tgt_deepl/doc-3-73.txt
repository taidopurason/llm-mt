Ülo Kalm: The elections promised a powerful new hospital.
The money comes from Brussels, but where will the staff and equipment come from?
How can a mayor whose father is Ülo and mother is Liidia manage to run a multi-ethnic city?
The former mayor Savisaari's belief that trust is eternal was sadly misplaced, and he put himself forward as a candidate again.
The star had gone out.
That trust is already proving to be more important than language and ethnicity is shown by the election results in Narva.
Doctors have to fight for trust with gut-cheaters who offer opinions instead of facts.
In addition, gentlemen who do not trust our hospital system at all have appeared in the limelight (or more precisely, in the columns).
I was just reading a Linas gentleman's tale of survival in PERH.
