In Nõmmel, a book pear hid a murder victim.
The case is in the hands of "cold murder" investigators
In 2019, the police received an unusual call to Lemmiku Street in Nõmme: during renovation work on an old house, it turned out that a dead body was hidden under a neatly stacked bookcase in one of the rooms.
How is this possible?
One elderly lady has been visited twice by investigators but has not yet been caught at a clear enough moment to answer the question.
She may hold the key to one of the murders: according to a source, she once said years ago that her son might be guilty of the crime.
