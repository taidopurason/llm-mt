Dinner had already been ordered and invitations sent: Finns decided to cancel the Presidential Ball at the last minute
The Finnish President's Office today announced that for the second year running, the traditional President's Ball will be cancelled on Independence Day.
The decision was essentially delayed until the last minute, as the event should have taken place on 6 December.
This means that a lot of hours have already been devoted to organising the ball.
Invitations were sent out some time ago and drinks and meals were ordered.
According to the office, nothing will be wasted and they can be used for future events.
Invitations issued this time will also be valid a year later, writes Iltalehti.
"Preparations for the reception took into account the low number of guests and therefore fewer items were stocked for the event," said a representative of the Chancellery.
The reason for the cancellation is the same as last year.
In particular, there are concerns about the rise in coronavirus infections.
However, Presidential couple Sauli Niinist√∂ and Jenni Haukio have found a way to celebrate Independence Day with their people.
On 6 December, the President and the First Lady will be interviewed live from the Palace by Yle.
The same broadcast will also feature a number of well-known musicians.
