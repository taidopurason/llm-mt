Gas instead of brake.
Controversial factory gets cornerstone despite ongoing litigation dispute
The plant will not be built until there is a court ruling, government officials said this summer.
However, the oil refinery was given the green light by ministers last Tuesday.
On 16 November, Eesti Energia laid the foundation stone for the Enefit280 oil shale oil plant, for the construction of which the government allocated €125 million of taxpayers' money and the construction of which was challenged in court by climate activists.
The more observant will remember that only six months earlier, the Tartu District Court suspended the construction permit for the plant under a preliminary injunction, and Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that a clear message was sent to Eesti Energia: until the end of the litigation, the plant must be put on hold.
In November, however, Eesti Energia pushed the gas bottom and started construction.
Legally, Eesti Energia is indeed entitled to start building the plant, as the Tartu District Court lifted the construction ban on the oil plant in early June.
However, the company took a commercial risk by laying the foundation stone for the plant, as the dispute over the legality of the building permit is still pending.
"In the event that the buildings and structures of the factory are finally erected at the end of the litigation, but the appeal is upheld and the building permit is annulled, the further course of the case will depend on the reasoning of the courts.
It is entirely possible that the buildings will turn out to be illegal, and theoretically there is a possibility that they will have to be demolished," explained Kärt Vaarmari, a lawyer at the Environmental Law Centre.
