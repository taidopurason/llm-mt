Setting a great example: Anett Kontaveit doesn't sit on her hands during the holidays and helps those in need
After a tiring tournament in Mexico, the Estonian top tennis player took some time off and is resting at home.
But at the same time, it helps those who need help.
Anett Kontaveit doesn't just sit back and relax, she makes the most of the time.
She posted pictures on Instagram of herself as a "plant-man", growing green plants at home.
And it is also involved in charity work, raising awareness of the work of the Shelters NGO.
Anett posted pictures of the dogs on social media, saying she would help them again this year.
At Monday's press conference, Anett Kontaveit said she had thought about aiming to win the Grand Slam.
"I've been thinking about it for a few days.
Of course, my dream is to win the big slamm, but the most important thing is that the goals are development-oriented.
I want to improve my game and certain elements of tennis, as well as my physique.
If this development process is positive, better results will come," he told Delfi Sport.
Kontaveit thanked the fans who stayed up late into the night in recent weeks for her matches in Mexico: "It's been very heartwarming to have so many people cheering me on.
I have received so much positive feedback and I am very grateful to everyone who cares about what I do.
I would also like to thank the supporters and sponsors who have got me here."
After a short break, Kontaveit will start to prepare for the new season in Tallinn and will fly to a warmer place to acclimatise as the Australian tournaments approach.
