Chamber of Agriculture: production cannot be sacrificed to the green revolution
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce believes that climate neutrality is an effort that must be made by businesses, consumers and the state, but that the greening goals cannot be achieved by reducing local production and animal numbers.
The changes brought about by the green turnaround must also be economically feasible for businesses, and this will require a joint effort by businesses, consumers and the state.
The Chamber of Agriculture considers it important to have an understanding of the interaction between the climate package and the EU's grassroots strategies for Estonian agriculture and food production before making decisions.
A holistic assessment based on location and management practices is needed to provide an overview of the real environmental impact of the Estonian agricultural sector.
Nor can the greening objectives be achieved by reducing local production and animal numbers.
The Chamber of Agriculture and Industry supports the European Commission's commitment to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, although this will be a major challenge for our agriculture, food, forestry and rural sectors.
However, with every challenge comes opportunities that must be skilfully exploited, according to an opinion sent by the Chamber of Agriculture and Rural Development to the Ministry of Environment on the European Commission's "Objective 55" climate package, BNS reports.
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce, which last year spearheaded the import of Ukrainians under the leadership of its leader Roomet SÃµrmus, is trying to woo both the green turn and farmers - but the wants of farmers and climate hysterics are so different that it is difficult to reconcile them.
In addition, the future of farmers is also haunted by all sorts of ideological associations and pressure groups, such as animal rights activists, environmentalists, vegans and others whose activities are aimed at restricting and ending animal farming.
