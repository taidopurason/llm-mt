GP warning: flu is on the move!
This is a serious illness, it's not just a cold and a cough.
How to protect yourself?
There is a lot of talk about the coronavirus, its prevention and treatment.
Besides this, people tend to forget that there are many different respiratory viruses circulating in the autumn-winter season and the flu has already arrived in Estonia, so it's high time to protect yourself from the virus, says Triinu-Mari Ots, Head of the Laagri Family Medical Centre and family doctor, giving advice on how to recognise and prevent the flu.
The typical Estonian autumn cough, cold and sore throat season has begun, when acute viral infections of the upper respiratory tract caused by various viruses are prevalent.
"The most common causes are rhinovirus, RS virus, adenovirus and parainfluenza.
The general name for these diseases is acute respiratory viral infections, and they are treated for a specific symptom, be it a cough, sore throat, runny nose or headache," says Triinu-Mari Ots.
An exception is the influenza virus, which has a very specific course and can be identified by symptoms in the first days of illness.
"In this case, tests will also be taken to provide laboratory confirmation of the presence of the flu virus," says the GP.
This is important for prescribing treatment as well as for preventing or limiting outbreaks, for example in a workplace, gym or school.
