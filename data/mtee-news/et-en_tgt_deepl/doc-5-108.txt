A step towards sustainability: SEAT connects Spanish and Portuguese factories by rail to reduce CO2 emissions
Spanish carmaker SEAT has set itself the goal of becoming a carbon neutral company by 2050.
To achieve this, SEAT launched the environmental programme "Move to Zerø" to reduce CO2 emissions throughout the life cycle of products, services and mobility solutions.
Now, however, SEAT plans to take another step forward in its "Move to Zerø" strategy with a new rail service linking the Martorell (Spain) plant with the Volkswagen Autoeuropa plant in Palmela (Portugal).
Up to now, vehicles produced in Martorell were transported by train to Salobral (Madrid) and then delivered by lorry to various dealerships.
With the new line, the vehicles will arrive directly at the Palmela factory, from where they will be transported by truck for a final journey to the Azambuja distribution depot, 75 kilometres away.
The service will now start operating twice a week and is expected to carry more than 20 000 vehicles a year.
This will avoid 2,400 truck journeys a year and reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 43%.
The new train service, operated by Pecovasa Renfe in Mercancía, will consist of 16 wagons.
It has a maximum length of 500 metres and can carry up to 184 vehicles per trip.
From 2023, an 18-carriage train will be introduced, capable of carrying up to 200 vehicles at a time.
By 2024, hybrid locomotives will be on the rails, allowing the line to run on 100% electricity.
