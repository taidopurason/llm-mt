All the "Black Sale" discounted TVs can be seen on the Sony Center campaign page.
Both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos make this model a great TV for cinema nights.
Both the sound and picture are close to cinema quality, and the 4K resolution and HDR offer good contrast.

Sony's image enhancement technology adjusts the picture quality to be as close as possible to 4K.
With support for Apple AirPlay, Apple Homekit and Chromecast, you can connect other home devices to your smart TV without wires, streaming content over the network.
