Readers' magazine | Appikarje: the shopping trolley only had wobbly legs sticking out of it
A man rescued a child who had fallen into a shopping trolley in a shop.
Is the baby's place in the shopping trolley at all?!
"I was on my weekly shopping trip and was just about to turn in between the fridges, when I saw two legs with fins.
At first I didn't understand what was happening, but then I realised there was a baby in the trolley.
I don't dare to say for sure, but it's likely that the toddler was trying to crawl out from between the piles of food, feet first.
Or maybe he had sunk uncomfortably in between the goods and was sitting upside down," says Siim, describing the scene in the store.
