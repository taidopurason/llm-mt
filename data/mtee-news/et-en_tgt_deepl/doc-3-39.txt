"You can't say I'm not a woman."

The naturally high testosterone levels of Namibian sprinters Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi do not fit into the usual boundaries and are raising more and more questions.
During the Tokyo Olympics, Estonians were able to cheer on Maicel Uibo's wife Shaunae Miller-Uibo as she successfully defended her 400m title.
It was an overwhelming victory, but truth be told, all the potential threats fell away for one reason or another and the slender Bahamian had to win.
Figuratively speaking, the path to the gold medal was cleared with a broom.
The Bahraini quarter-miler Salwa Eid Naser, who took a surprise first place ahead of Miller-Uibo at the World Championships in Doha two years earlier, was penalised for failing to provide doping samples.
A new super-talented American born 19-year-old Athing Mu chose the 800 m, where she became Olympic champion.
And the Namibian teenage sprinters who have shown very fast times this year (Christine Mboma ran 48.54 and Beatrice Masilingi 49.53) were banned by the World Athletics Association (WA) from competing in the 400m due to high testosterone levels.
But what will become of them?
Mboma and Masilingi, who finished second and sixth in the 200 m in Tokyo, are still controversial.
Nobody seems to be happy.
Some think they have been discriminated against, others believe the duo should not be competing among women at all.
The issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible, as observers say it is only a matter of time before Mboma, with his very poor start but unprecedented final speed, starts setting world records.
