Government makes an exception: more spectators allowed for Estonia-Israel selection match
The government has deemed the men's basketball World Cup qualifying match between the Estonian and Israeli national teams in Tallinn's Saku Great Hall this Sunday to be an event of overriding public interest and will allow up to 3,360 spectators to the game.
Under the current restrictions, a maximum of 1,000 spectators will be allowed to attend indoor sports competitions from 15 November.
The health authority will support the event with an increased number of spectators if the organiser mitigates the risk of coronavirus transmission in line with the plan submitted, the government said on its website.
The spectators would be divided into four zones in the Saku Suurhalle and would not come into contact with each other, the players or the match officials.
Access to the event is only granted on presentation of a COVID certificate and a mask will be checked on the spot.
Sectors have been designed with a view to dispersing people and providing separate ventilation for each area.
The use of trombones and the like is prohibited.
The Estonian Basketball Association is making a publicity campaign to ensure that spectators arrive in good time to avoid queues at the entrance to check certificates and documents.
Doors open one hour before the event.
In total, there are 14 different entrances on the four levels.
The Estonian national team kicks off the 2023 World Cup selection series on Thursday evening when they face Germany in Nuremberg.
Tickets for Sunday's game against Israel can be purchased from the Ticket Bag.
