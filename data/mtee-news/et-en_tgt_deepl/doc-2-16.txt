THE DISTANCE LEARNING IN TALLIN WAS POINTLESS!
The rapid testing of schools gave the same good result!
The four-week distance learning programme for 4th-8th graders in Tallinn schools did not give the city an advantage when it came to warding off coronas, as the rapid tests achieved the same results as in open school areas, dry figures confirm.
For a shorter period of time, distance training was also held in Pärnu and partly also in Narva, but in Tallinn it started right after the school holidays and stretches for four weeks.
Researchers analysing corona have now an excellent basis for comparing Tallinn versus the rest of Estonia.
After future national exams, for example, it will be possible to see whether four weeks of absence from school also means poorer results compared to the rest of the country.
But the more important question now is whether Tallinn's decision to shift municipal schools to long-distance training has given the city more success in the fight against basketball.
After all, there was friction between Toompea and the Lower Town because of the actions of Mayor Mihhail Kõlvarti.
