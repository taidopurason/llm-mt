Poach nuts from a local nut producer for Santa's gift bag
Sweets, different kinds of baguettes and chocolate bars - seem like the usual choice for Santa's gift bag or Santa's sushi?
In reality, they are not healthy at all.
Instead, you could treat your child or loved one to something healthy at Christmas time.
A variety of nuts, almonds and seeds have health benefits.
Some may raise an eyebrow, saying that nuts are also high in fat - so could they not be equated with sweets?
No, definitely not.
If you look at the label on a packet of nuts, you will read that the fats in nuts are almost entirely made up of healthy unsaturated fatty acids, which are essential for the body, with a small amount of saturated fatty acids and no trans fats.
Fats are good for our bodies and should not be completely avoided.
However, it is important to choose unsaturated fats, or good fats, which are found in nuts, seeds and almonds.
So the only Estonian nut producer Germund Hulgi recommends choosing healthy snacks for Christmas.
Particularly popular are Germund Hulg's black Premium packs, which contain the largest nuts and dried fruit.
For example, hazelnuts come from Georgia, almonds from California, raisins and cranberries from Chile, and Indian nuts from Vietnam.
Roasting, salting, blending into tasty mixtures and packaging are all done in Estonia.
