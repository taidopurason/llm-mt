Mihkel Raud on coronet hijinks on social media: it's like 15 minutes of fame that make it easy to get sympathy from others
"Life is what comes when you have other plans," he said. a wise man once said.
I think the man was John Lennon.
Although we tend to attribute genius quotes to the people we like the most, so it could be that someone else uttered those wise words instead of Lennon.
But the core of the sentence changes little, of course.
I had beautiful plans.
I had to perform with Singer Vinger in Sindi, then take a bus back to Tallinn and the next day participate in the final of "Estonia is looking for a superstar" - exactly as I had performed, travelled and participated countless times over the dozen years.
But life got ahead of my plans.
"I'm not feeling very well, why don't we drive straight into town?" I tried to dissuade Singer Vinger's companions from yet another forest hunt.
We had already made three of them.
The bus turned into the woods, the men were smoking outside, and I could feel my fever rising by the second.
And if you now think you've stumbled on yet another COVIDi stick, you're only half right.
