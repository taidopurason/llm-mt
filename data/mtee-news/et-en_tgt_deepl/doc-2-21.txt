Mart Seim: I'm the only one of the super-heavy lifters who competed at the Rio Olympics who hasn't been caught with banned substances
Estonia's most successful lifter Mart Seim and his counterpart Leho Pent are preparing for the World Championships which start in two weeks.
If their favourite sport remains on the Olympic programme, both want to compete at least until the Paris Games in 2024.
This summer's Tokyo Olympics were interrupted by a coronavirus suffered in the spring, which confined both Mard and Leho to their beds and did not allow them to regain their athletic form for the European Championships.
