French fishermen block traffic on the English Channel to demand fishing rights
French fishermen will block barge traffic at three Channel ports and freight traffic in a tunnel between France and Britain on Friday to demand post-Brexit fishing rights, a union said.
Gerard Romiti, chairman of the French National Committee for Fisheries (CNPMEM), described the protest as a warning shot and said traffic would be blocked at the ports of Saint-Malo, Ouistreham and Calais, as well as the Eurotunnel, for several hours.
The long-running dispute between Britain and France over fishing licences remains unresolved and threatens to escalate into a full-scale trade war.
"We don't want donations, we just want our promises back.
The UK must respect the post-Brexit deal," Romiti said.
"We have been holding our breath for 11 months.
The patience of professionals has limits.
We hope this warning will be heeded," he said, without ruling out further action.
France has threatened to ban British fishing boats from unloading their catches in French ports and impose stricter controls on all British imports.
According to President Emmanuel Macron, such measures are expected to give a chance to negotiations, but French officials stress that all options are still on the table.
Negotiations between French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune and British Brexit Minister David Frost have so far failed to bear fruit.
Under last year's agreement between Britain and the European Union, European fishing vessels can continue to fish in British waters if they can prove they have done so in the past.
According to Paris, several dozens of French vessels have had their applications rejected without justification.
London denies this.
