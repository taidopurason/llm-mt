Matthew Hill, who moved to Estonia from Australia, and his wife, Piret, set up a grassland plantation in Läänemaa.
On his vegetable garden, however, the farmer practices shovel-less soil cultivation, or sustainable farming, which is already very popular in other parts of the world: no digging, just light aeration.
