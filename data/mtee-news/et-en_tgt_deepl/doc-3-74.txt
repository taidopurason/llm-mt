Alo Raun: congratulations, 55% support for the Cohabitation Act!
55% - Today, the Cohabitation Act has the support of an absolute majority of Estonian citizens aged 18 and over who have a view on the issue, according to opinion polls.
Maybe people who can also vote for the parliament and take part in referendums.
These are the aggregate results of the September and October polls conducted by Norstat and commissioned by the Liberal Citizen.
This trend has been going on for some time, according to the same survey.
So when we talk about what "the people want", it is no longer correct to say that we/they are against the Cohabitation Act.
