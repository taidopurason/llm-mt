Make your own candles with a small footprint
If you pour candles before the holidays, try a Nordic and natural rapeseed wax.
Wax from rapeseed is a renewable and environmentally friendly raw material.
It's time for the annual autumn candle-lighting.
Candles can be made in spring and summer, but autumn is the perfect time to make them.
It's dark and rainy outside, the wind is howling.
At the same time, candle wax melts in a pot on the stove and wonderful aromas fill the room.
These are magical moments.
Our ancestors used to make candles out of precious lamp-wood and they were only used on special occasions.
Nowadays, there are many different materials and tools available for making candles.
Finding your way around them can be confusing.
