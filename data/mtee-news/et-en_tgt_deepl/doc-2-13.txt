Vambola Paavo | Let's follow Hungary's example and set a maximum price for petrol
A month ago, I was listening to a radio programme called "Prime Minister in the studio".
When a reporter asked Kaja Kallas how much a litre of fuel costs at petrol stations, silence followed.
The Prime Minister declared vaguely, I don't know.
At a time when the world's energy prices are rising, the head of government knows how much something costs!
Consequently, he has lively and bad advisers.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, on the other hand, knows and knows well.
Hungary has fixed fuel prices nationally for three months.
They must not be more than 500 forints, or €1.42 per litre, at petrol stations.
Currently, the fixed price for three months is 480 forints, or €1.37 per litre.
Prices are reviewed every three months.
The ceiling was prompted by accelerating inflation and is the highest in the country in nine years - 6.5 percent.
Under the decision, petrol companies can sell cheaper, but not more.
