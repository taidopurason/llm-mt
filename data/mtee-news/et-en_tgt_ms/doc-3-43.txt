The meal had already been ordered and invitations sent: the Finns decided to cancel the presidential ball at the last moment
The Office of the President of Finland announced today that for the second year in a row, the traditional presidential ball will be cancelled on Independence Day.
The decision was essentially delayed until the last moment, as the event should have taken place as early as 6 December.
This means that many hours of work have already been devoted to the organization of the ball.
Some time ago, invitations were sent out, and drinks and meals were also ordered.
According to the office, nothing will be wasted, but they can already be used at subsequent events.
Also, invitations sent out this time will continue to be valid in a year's time, writes Iltalehti.
"Preparations for the reception took into account the small number of guests, and therefore fewer items were stockpiled for the event," a clerk's office representative said.
The reason for Ball's cancellation is the same as it was last year.
Notably, there are concerns about the rise in coronavirus infections.
However, presidential couple Sauli Niinist√∂ and Jenni Haukio have found a way to celebrate Independence Day with their people.
On December 6, the president and frontman will give an interview to Yle directly from the palace.
Several well-known musicians also perform as part of the same broadcast.
