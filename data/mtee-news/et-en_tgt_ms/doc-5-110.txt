European Medicines Agency green light: Pfizer coronavirus vaccine is suitable for children aged 5-11 years
The European Medicines Agency on Thursday recommended extending the use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine Comirnaty to children ages 5 to 11.
Until now, the vaccine was allowed for people aged 12 and over.
The dose of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for children aged 5-11 years is three times lower than the usual dose (10 μg compared to 30 μg).
As in the older age group, children are given a course of vaccines in two shots with an interval of three weeks.
A clinical study conducted with 2000 children showed that 5- to 11-year-olds received immune responses at three times lower doses at the same rate as older age groups with a full dose.
The side effects were similar to those in the older age group and were mild or moderate and resolved within a few days.
Therefore, the European Medicines Agency concluded that the benefits of the vaccine in children aged 5-11 years outweigh its risks.
The Agency will now send the recommendation to the European Commission, which will take the final decision on the use of the vaccine.
Marje Oona, a member of the national immunoprophylaxis expert committee, told the ERR that the commission will probably make a decision on the matter next week.
"With the approval of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), we know that the approval of the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been in place for some time.
The US Immunization Committee has already made this recommendation quite a while ago, and more than three million children have already been vaccinated in the United States, so I actually see little reason not to be given.
But we haven't discussed it yet," Dr. Oona commented.
