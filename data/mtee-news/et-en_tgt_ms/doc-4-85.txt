A green transition or just plain stupidity in a cube: toilets and trash cans disappearing from the edge of state roads
Another example of austerity comes from the Department of Transportation, which goes against the green thinking that we have so widely introduced.
As the Transport Administration will have to cut operating costs by more than 3.5 million euros in the coming year, the removal of toilets and trash cans from car parks was identified as one of the savings.
The decision was made on the basis that road safety will suffer the least by cutting these costs, Raido Randmaa, director of the Infrastructure Management Service of the Transport Administration, explained to the ERR.
There are toilets belonging to the Transport Administration in 61 car parks all over Estonia, and garbage containers in 63 parking lots.
The Agency spends EUR 472 000 per year on toilets and EUR 267 000 on bins.
According to Randmaa, this decision has already been made by the Transport Administration, but since the agency's budget has not yet been finally approved, there is no signature on this decision.
"Well, come to the rescue in heaven â€“ as a former Circle K leader and today the head of Ragn-Sells, I can't shut up," kai Realo, a top executive, comments on social media about the decision.
"When Circle K wanted to build service stations along the new highways, where both trash cans and toilets are known, the biggest hassle was to get locations where the then Road Administration would have given normal pick-ups and drop-offs, because 'Estonia is so small that a person here can drive the whole country from edge to edge at the same time and he does not need to refuel, eat or go to the toilet on the road'."
Realo adds that this attitude took a tongue-in-cheek approach at the time, but the decision now was downright insane: "Can you imagine this 'land of men in the burrows' and those piles of rubbish in the woods?"
