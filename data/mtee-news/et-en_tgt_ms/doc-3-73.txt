Ülo Kalm: a new powerful hospital was promised in the elections.
The money comes from Brussels, but where do the staff and equipment come from?
How can the mayor, whose father is Ülo and mother Lidia, cope with the management of a multiethnic city?
Sadly funny was the belief of the former mayor Savisaar that trust is eternal and he again presented himself as an ambassadorial candidate.
The star had gone out.
That trust is already proving to be more important than language and nationality, the election result in Narva shows.
Doctors need to fight for trust with salt blowers who offer opinions instead of facts.
In addition, gentlemen who do not trust our hospital system at all have also appeared in the limelight (specifically on the page columns).
I have just read the confession of a townsfolk gentleman about surviving in PERH.
