Mihkel Raud about the coronavirus reproaches in social media: it's like 15 minutes of fame, which makes it easy to lure sympathy from others
"Life is what comes when you have other plans," a wise man once said.
I guess that man was John Lennon.
Although we tend to attribute ingenious quotes to the people we like the most, it may be that instead of Lennon, these wise words were uttered by someone else.
But the core of the sentence, of course, changes little from that.
I had beautiful plans.
I had to perform with Singer Vinger in Sindh, then take the bus back to Tallinn and take part in the final show "Estonia is looking for a superstar" the next day â€“ just as I had performed, traveled and participated countless times in a dozen years.
But life got ahead of my plans.
"I'm not feeling very well, maybe we're driving straight into town?" I tried to push Singer Vinger's companions to give up another stop in the woods.
We had already made three pieces of them.
The bus turned down into the woods, the men were making smoke outside, and I could feel the fever rising with every second.
And if you now think you've stumbled upon another COVID hit, you're only half right.
