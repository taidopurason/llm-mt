On the heath, a stack of books hid the murder victim.
The case is in the hands of investigators of the "cold murders"
In 2019, the police received an unusual call to NÃµmme on Lemmik Street: during the renovation of the old house, it turned out that a corpse hidden under a stack of books was neatly stacked in one of the rooms.
How is this possible?
One elderly lady has been visited twice by investigators, but there is not yet a clear enough moment to answer the question that has been caught.
She may hold the key to one murder: she once said years ago that her son might be guilty of a crime, according to one source.
