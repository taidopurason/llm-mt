Reader's Letter | Scream for help: only slender legs stood out from the shopping cart
A man rescued a child who had sunk between goods from a shopping cart in a store.
Is the child's place in the shopping cart at all?!
"I was on my weekly shopping trip and was currently turning between the cold counters when two slender legs popped up in front of my eyes.
At first I didn't understand what was going on, but then I realized that there was a child in the shopping cart.
I don't dare say for sure, but the toddler was probably trying to climb out of the piles of food in front of his feet.
Or maybe it had sunk awkwardly between the goods and it was pretty upside down when I set myself up," Siim describes the sight that opened up in the store.
