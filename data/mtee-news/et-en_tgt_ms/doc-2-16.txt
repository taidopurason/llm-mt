TALLINN DISTANCE LEARNING WAS POINTLESS!
Rapid testing of schools gave the same good result!
Four-week distance learning in grades 4-8 in Tallinn schools did not give the city an advantage in controlling the coronavirus, as rapid tests achieved the same result in areas with open schools, dry figures confirm.
For a shorter period of time, distance learning also took place in Pärnu and partly also in Narva, but in Tallinn it started immediately after the school holidays and stretches for a total of four weeks.
Researchers analysing the coronavirus have now developed an excellent reference base between Tallinn and the rest of Estonia.
After future state exams, it can be examined, for example, whether four weeks of absenteeism also means poorer results compared to the rest of the country.
However, the most important question now is whether Tallinn's decision to direct municipal schools to long distance learning gave the city greater success in the fight against the coronavirus.
After all, there was also a friction between Toompea and the sub-city due to the actions of Mayor Mikhail Kõlvart.
