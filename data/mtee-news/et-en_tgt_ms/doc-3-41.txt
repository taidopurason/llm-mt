The government made an exception: more spectators will be allowed for the Estonian-Israeli selection game
The government counted the men's basketball World Cup qualifying match between the Estonian and Israeli national teams to be held this Sunday in Saku Suurhall in Tallinn as an event of overwhelming social interest and will allow up to 3360 spectators to attend the game.
Under the current restrictions, up to 1000 spectators are allowed to participate in indoor sports competitions from November 15.
The Health Board will support the event with an increased number of spectators if the organiser mitigates the risk of spreading the coronavirus according to the submitted plan, the government announced on its website.
Spectators would be divided into four zones in Saku Suurhall and would not come into contact with each other, with the players or with the staff serving the game.
You can enter the event only upon presentation of the COVID certificate and the wearing of a mask is checked on the spot.
The sectors take into account that people are dispersed and separate ventilation is provided for each area.
The use of trumpets and the like is prohibited.
The Estonian Basketball Association makes advance notification so that spectators arrive at the game well in advance to avoid queues at the entrance when checking certificates and documents.
Doors open one hour before the start of the event.
A total of 14 different entrances are open for four levels.
The Estonian national team will start the 2023 World Cup qualifying series on Thursday evening, facing Germany in Nuremberg.
Tickets for Sunday's game with Israel can be purchased from the Ticket Pocket.
