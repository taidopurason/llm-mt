Mart Seim: I am the only one of the super heavyweight weightlifters who have competed at the Rio Olympics who have not been caught with banned substances
Estonia's most successful weightlifter Mart Seim and his counterpart Leho Pent are preparing for the World Cup, which starts in two weeks.
If their favorite sport still remains on the Olympic schedule, both will want to compete until at least the 2024 Paris Games.
The dash to this summer's pursuit of the Tokyo Olympics was drawn by the coronavirus suffered in the spring, which chained both Mardi and Leho to a bed of disease and did not allow EMI to regain athletic form.
