Alo Raun: congratulations, 55% support the Cohabitation Act!
55% â€“ today, according to opinion polls, the Registered Partnership Act has the support of an absolute majority, if you look at Estonian citizens aged 18 and over who have a position on the matter.
That is, people who can also elect the Riigikogu and participate in a referendum.
This is according to the aggregate results of the September and October polls conducted by Norstat and commissioned by SA Liberal Citizen.
Such a trend has been going on for a long time, according to the same poll.
So when we talk about what "the people want", it is no longer correct to say that we/they are against the cohabitation law.
