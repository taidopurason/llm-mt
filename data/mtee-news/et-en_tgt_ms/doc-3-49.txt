Make your own candles with a small footprint
Whoever pours candles before the holidays will experiment with Nordic and natural rapeseed wax.
Wax produced from rapeseed is a renewable and environmentally friendly raw material.
It's the time for candlesticking every autumn.
After all, candles can also be made in spring and summer, but in autumn this operation is immediately especially suitable.
It's twilight and rainy outside, the wind is blazing.
At the same time, candle wax melts in a pot on the stove, and wonderful aromas fill the room.
These are magical moments.
Our foremothers made candles from valuable mutton fat and were used only on special occasions.
Today, many different materials and tools are available for the manufacture of candles.
Orienting yourself in them can be confusing.
