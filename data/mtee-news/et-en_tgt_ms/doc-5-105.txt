Three very good Sony TVs that can now be picked up at a very good price with "Black Sale"
Not only are Sony TVs designed to watch TV channels, but with many additional apps, they can also be used for all kinds of other entertainment, from Youtube and Netflix to special sports broadcasts, games and even social media, because they have Google TV as their operating system.
Now, with "Black Sale," some very good screens can be picked up at an even better price.
Discounts reach up to a thousand euros.
Here are three decent offers, from which you will definitely find the right one for your needs.
All the "Black Sale" discount TVs can be seen on the Sony Center campaign page.
Both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos make this model a good movie night TV.
Both sound and image are of close quality to cinema, in addition, 4K resolution and HDR provide a good contrasting image.
However, the 4K X-Reality PRO is necessary when you are watching TV shows or videos that do not match the quality of the 4K screen.
Sony's pilid repair technology adjusts the image quality to make it as close as possible to 4K.
With support for Apple AirPlay, Apple Homekit, and Chromecast, you can connect other home devices to your smart TV without wired by streaming content over a network.
This model is currently available at a discount of 150 euros, i.e. at a price 19% less.
