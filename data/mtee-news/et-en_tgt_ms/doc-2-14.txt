CHINESE MEDICINE RECOMMENDS: this plant should be now in every home!
In autumn winter, when it is dreary and humid outside, it is necessary to strengthen and warm the body.
For this purpose, several medicinal plants are suitable, which keep warm inside, but do not allow excessive heat to form.
It is very convenient to put both plants and hot water in a thermos, take it with you to work or school, and drink tea that supports the body during the day, recommended on the Health Alchemy blog.
When the tea runs out, boiling water can be added to the plants several times.
