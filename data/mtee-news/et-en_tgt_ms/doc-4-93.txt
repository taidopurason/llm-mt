Chamber of Agriculture: production cannot be sacrificed to the green transition
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce believes that businesses, consumers and the state must make efforts to achieve climate neutrality, but at the same time, achieving the green transition goals cannot be achieved by reducing local production and the number of animals.
The changes brought about by the green transition must also be economically feasible for businesses, which must be pursued by entrepreneurs, consumers and the state together.
The Chamber of Agriculture considers it important to have an understanding of the interplay between the climate package and the EU Green Deal strategies on Estonian agricultural and food production before making decisions.
In order to get an overview of the real environmental impact of the Estonian agricultural sector, a comprehensive assessment based on location and management method is needed.
Nor can the objectives of the green transition be achieved through local production and a reduction in the number of animals.
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce supports the direction taken by the European Commission to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, although this will be a major challenge for our agricultural, food, forestry and rural sectors.
However, each challenge also comes with opportunities that need to be skilfully exploited, according to the opinion sent by the Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce to the Ministry of the Environment on the European Commission's Fit for 55 climate package, mediated by BNS.
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce, which last year was the initiator of the import of Ukrainians led by its leader Roomet Ring, is trying to make eye contact with both the green transition and farmers â€“ at the same time, the wants of farmers and climate hysterics are so different that it is difficult to reconcile them.
In addition, farmers' futures are also haunted by all sorts of ideological associations and pressure groups, such as animal and environmentalists, vegans and others whose actions are aimed at restricting and ending animal husbandry.
