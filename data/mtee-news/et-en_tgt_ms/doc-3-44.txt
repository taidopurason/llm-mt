A great role model: Anett Kontaveit does not sit idly by while on vacation and helps those in need
After a tiring tournament in Mexico, the Estonian premier tennis player took time off for a while and is resting in his homeland.
But during it, he helps those who need help.
Anett Kontaveit does not rest idly by, but practically takes advantage of this time.
She posted pictures on Instagram of herself calling herself a "plant-mommy," growing plants that provide greenery at home.
And is also engaged in charity work, raising awareness about the activities of the Shelters NGO.
Anett posted pictures of the dogs on social media, saying she would also help them this year.
At Monday's press conference, Anett Kontaveit said she had thought about aiming to win a Grand Slam tournament.
"I've been thinking about it for a couple of days.
Of course, my dream is to win a Grand Slam, but the most important thing is that the goals are development-based.
I want to improve my game and certain tennis elements, as well as my physique.
If this development process is positive, there will be better results," he said via Delfi Sport.
Kontaveit thanked fans who stayed up in the deep hours of the night for his Mexican Games in recent weeks: "It's been very heartwarming how many people have lived with me.
I have received so much positive feedback and I am very grateful to everyone who cares about what I do.
I also thank the supporters and sponsors who have made it here."
After a short rest, Kontaveit begins to prepare for the new season in Tallinn and, as tournaments in Australia approach, flies to some warmer places to acclimatize.
