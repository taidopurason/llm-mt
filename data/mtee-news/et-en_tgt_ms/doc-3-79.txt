The family doctor warns: the flu is on the move!
This is a serious illness, it is not just a runny nose and cough.
How to protect yourself?
There is a lot of talk about the coronavirus, its prevention and treatment.
In addition to this, it tends to be forgotten that during the autumn-winter season, a lot of different respiratory viruses are on the move, and the flu has already reached Estonia, so it is high time to protect yourself from the virus, says Triinu-Mari Ots, the head of Laagri Family Medicine Centre and family doctor, giving advice on how to recognize and prevent the flu.
The typical Estonian autumn-winter cough-runny nose-sore throat season has begun, when acute viral infections of the upper respiratory tract caused by various viruses are mainly on the move.
"The more common causative agents are rhinovirus, RS virus, adenovirus and paraglider.
The common name for these diseases is acute respiratory viral infections, and in their case a specific symptom is treated, be it cough, sore throat, runny nose or headache," says Triinu-Mari Ots.
The exception is the influenza virus, the course of which is very specific and can be determined already in the first days of illness by symptoms.
"In this case, tests will also be taken to provide laboratory confirmation of the presence of the influenza virus," the family doctor says.
This is important both when prescribing treatment and for preventing or limiting lesions, for example, in a work collective, training hall or school.
