Gas instead of brake.
The controversial plant became the cornerstone despite ongoing litigation
There will be no construction of the plant until there is a court ruling, government members said in the summer of this year.
Yet on Tuesday last week, the oil plant became the cornerstone with ministerial approval.
On 16 November, Eesti Energia laid the cornerstone for the shale oil plant Enefit280, for the construction of which the government allocated 125 million euros of taxpayers' money to the state-owned company and the construction of which was sued by climate youth.
Those who are more attentive will remember that just half a year earlier, the Tartu District Court suspended the construction permit for the plant by way of interim legal protection, and Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that a clear message was sent to Eesti Energia: until the end of the litigation, the brakes must be put on the construction of the plant.
In November, however, Eesti Energia pressed gas to the bottom and started construction.
Legally, Eesti Energia does indeed have the right to start building the plant, because at the beginning of June, the Tartu District Court lifted the construction ban imposed on the oil plant.
However, the company took a business risk by laying the cornerstone for the plant, as the dispute over the legality of the building permit is still ongoing.
"In the event that the buildings and structures of the factory have been erected at the end of the litigation, but the appeal is upheld and the building permit is revoked, the further course of action will depend on the reasoning of the courts.
It is quite possible for buildings to turn out to be illegal, and in theory there is a possibility that they will have to be demolished," explained KÃ¤rt Vaarmari, a lawyer at the Environmental Law Centre.
