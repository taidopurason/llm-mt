Vambola Paavo | Let us set a maximum price for petrol, following the example of Hungary
I found myself listening to the show "There's a Prime Minister in the Studio" on the radio a month ago.
When a reporter asked Kaja Kallas how much a litre of fuel costs at filling stations, silence followed.
The Prime Minister announced tentatively, I don't know.
At a time when energy carriers are becoming more expensive in the world, so know the head of government how much something costs!
Consequently, he has life-giving and bad advisers.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, on the other hand, knows and very well.
Hungary fixed fuel prices nationally for three months.
They must not be more than 500 forints or 1.42 euros per liter at filling stations.
Currently, the fixed price for three months is 480 forints, or 1.37 euros per liter.
Prices are reviewed every three months.
The cap was driven by accelerated inflation and is the country's highest in nine years at 6.5 percent.
According to the decision, gas station chains may sell cheaper, but not more expensively.
