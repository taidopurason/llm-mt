Store in Santa's gift bag nuts from a domestic nut maker
Candy, various bars and chocolate bars – seems like a standard choice in Santa's gift bag or elf's slipper?
In reality, they are not healthy at all.
Instead, a child or a loved one could be delighted with something healthy during the Christmas period.
Various nuts, almonds and seeds are good for health.
Many may frown when they say that there are also a lot of fats in nuts – couldn't they be equated with candy?
No, definitely not.
If you look at the label on the nut packet, you can read that the fats in the nuts consist almost entirely of healthy unsaturated fatty acids that are very necessary for the body, there is a small amount of saturated fatty acids, and trans fats are completely absent.
Fats are good for our body and should not be avoided completely.
However, it is important to prefer unsaturated fatty acids, i.e. good fats, which can be obtained from nuts, seeds and almonds.
So, the only Estonian nut producer Germund Wholesale recommends choosing healthy snacks on Christmas holidays.
Especially popular are the premium packs of Germund Bulk black, into which the largest nuts and dried fruits reach.
For example, wild nuts come from Georgia, almonds from California, raisins and cranberries from Chile, cashew nuts from Vietnam.
However, roasting, salting, mixing into delicious mixtures and packaging takes place in Estonia.
