Namibian sprinters Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi, who are naturally high in testosterone, do not fit within normal limits and raise more and more questions.
During the Tokyo Olympics, the Estonians were able to empathize with Maicel Uibo's husband, Shaunae Miller-Uibo, when she successfully defended the title of the 400-meter run.
The victory was overwhelming, but to give credit to the truth, all possible threats fell away for one reason or another, and the slender Bahamasas had to win.
Figuratively speaking, the path to the gold medal was cleared with a broomstick.
Salwa Eid Naser, a Bahraini quarter-star who surprisingly snapped first place ahead of Miller-Uibo at the Doha World Cup two years earlier, was serving a sentence for failing doping tests.
19-year-old Athing Mu, a new super talent who grew up in America, chose the 800m distance, where he became an Olympic champion.
And teenage Namibian sprinters who showed very busy times this year (Christine Mboma ran a time of 48.54 and Beatrice Masiling's time of 49.53) were banned from participating in the 400m race by the World Athletics Federation (WA) due to too high testosterone levels.
But what happens next for them?
Mboma and Masilingi, who came second and sixth in the 200m race in Tokyo, are still causing controversy.
It's as if no one is satisfied.
Some think they have been discriminated against, some believe that this duo should not compete among women at all.
The issue demands a solution as soon as possible because, according to observers, it is only a matter of time before Mboma begins to set world records with a very poor start but with an unprecedented final speed.
