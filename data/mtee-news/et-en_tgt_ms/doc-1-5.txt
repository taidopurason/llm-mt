French fishermen block traffic on the English Channel to claim fishing rights
French fishermen will block ferry traffic in three English Channel ports and freight traffic in the tunnel between France and Britain on Friday to claim post-Brexit fishing rights, the trade union said.
Gerard Romiti, chairman of the French National Fisheries Committee (CNPMEM), described the protest as a warning shot and said traffic would be blocked in the ports of Saint-Malo, Ouistreham and Calais, as well as in the Eurotunnel, for several hours.
The months-long dispute between Britain and France over fishing permits remains unresolved and threatens to escalate into a full-scale trade war.
"We don't want donations, we just want our permits back.
The UK must abide by the post-Brexit deal," Romiti said.
"We've been holding our breath for 11 months.
There are limits to the patience of professionals.
We hope that this warning shot will be heard," he said, without ruling out further action.
France has threatened to ban British fishing vessels from unloading their catches in French ports and impose stricter controls on all British imports.
President Emmanuel Macron said such measures were expected to give way to negotiations, but French officials insist all options are still on the table.
Negotiations between French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune and British Brexit Minister David Frost have so far not borne fruit.
Under last year's agreement between Britain and the European Union, European fishing vessels can continue fishing in British waters if they can prove they did so in the past.
Paris claims that the requests of several dozen French vessels have been wrongly rejected.
London denies this.
