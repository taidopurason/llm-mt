A step towards sustainability: SEAT connects factories in Spain and Portugal with a train path to reduce CO2 emissions
Spanish automaker SEAT has set a goal of becoming a carbon-neutral company by 2050.
To achieve this, SEAT launched the 'Move to Zerø' environmental programme to reduce CO2 emissions throughout the life cycle of products, services and mobility solutions.
Now, however, SEAT intends to establish another step forward in the 'Move to Zerø' strategy with a new rail service linking the Martorell (Spain) plant with the Volkswagen Autoeuropa plant in Palmela (Portugal).
Until now, vehicles produced in Martorelli were transported by train to Saloblasti (Madrid) and from there were delivered by truck to various dealerships.
With the new line, the vehicles will reach directly the Palmela plant, from where they will be taken by truck for the last time to the Azambuja distribution depot, which is 75 kilometers away.
At the moment, the service will operate twice a week and is expected to transport more than 20,000 vehicles a year.
This will prevent 2400 lorries a year and reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 43%.
The new train service, operated by Pecovasa Renfe Mercancías, consists of 16 wagons.
It has a maximum length of 500 meters and allows you to transport up to 184 vehicles per trip.
As of 2023, a train of 18 wagons will be put into operation, capable of transporting almost 200 vehicles at a time.
By 2024, hybrid locomotives will start running on the tracks, which will allow the track to use 100% electricity.
