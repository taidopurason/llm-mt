Channel deaths: Boris Johnson sets out five-point plan to address crossings following tragedy
The prime minister's letter comes after 27 people - 17 men, seven women and two teenage boys and a girl - died near Calais on Wednesday while trying to cross the English Channel in a flimsy boat.
Boris Johnson has offered to work with France to "move further and faster" in order to tackle small boat crossings and avoid a repeat of the "appalling tragedy" in the Channel that left 27 people dead.
The prime minister has written to President Emmanuel Macron and set out five steps he thinks both sides should take "as soon as possible".
Mr Johnson's letter comes after 27 people - 17 men, seven women and two teenage boys and a girl - died near Calais on Wednesday while trying to cross the English Channel in a flimsy boat.
The PM's five-point plan entails:
• Joint patrols to prevent boats from leaving French beaches
• Using more advanced technology such as sensors and radar
• Carry out reciprocal maritime patrols in each nation's territorial waters and utilise airborne surveillance
• "Deepening the work" of the Joint Intelligence Cell and ensuring there is better intelligence sharing to drive more arrests and prosecutions
• Committing to "immediate work" to strike a bilateral returns agreement between Paris and London, as well as discussions on a UK-EU agreement
"If those who reach this country were swiftly returned the incentive for people to put their lives in the hands of traffickers would be significantly reduced," Mr Johnson said.
"This would be the single biggest step we could take together to reduce the draw to Northern France and break the business model of criminal gangs.
"I am confident that by taking these steps and building on our existing cooperation we can address illegal migration and prevent more families from experiencing the devastating loss we saw yesterday."
The PM said that having spoken to the French president in the wake of Wednesday's tragedy "I know President Macron recognises, as I do, the urgency of the situation we are both facing".
Home Secretary Priti Patel will meet French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin this weekend to discuss the migrant crisis, along with counterparts from Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
In his letter to Mr Macron, Mr Johnson said he was ready to "upgrade this meeting to a leaders' level summit or to arrange further bilateral discussions with you or with colleagues".
Ms Patel and her French counterpart spoke on the phone on Thursday to "put forward plans for greater collaboration and innovation in stopping these deadly crossings".
Home Office officials and law enforcement officers will be in Paris on Friday to "intensify joint co-operation and intelligence-sharing".
Expedia stops selling holidays that include experiences with captive dolphins and whales
Following changes to Expedia's animal welfare policy, the company said "attractions and activities that involve performances by or interactions with dolphins and other cetaceans will no longer be available on our sites".
Travel company Expedia has stopped selling holidays that involve performances by dolphins and whales in captivity.
Expedia Group said: "We recently adjusted our animal welfare policy.
"As a result, attractions and activities that involve performances by or interactions with dolphins and other cetaceans will no longer be available on our sites."
A spokesman told the Mail on Sunday that the company will continue to sell tickets to "seaside sanctuaries that provide captive animals with a permanent seaside living environment" if they "are accredited and do not feature interactions or performances".
The firm said the change will take time to implement and it intends to complete the process by early 2022.
Channel deaths: People smugglers touting openly on Facebook
Sky News has uncovered a network of smugglers posting routes into Europe openly on social media.
Finding a route across the channel is as easy as typing "smuggler" into Facebook.
Far from being a hidden world, Sky News has found that a network of smugglers is operating openly on the social media platform.
Routes into Europe and the UK are regularly highlighted, with posts featuring images of the Union Jack and Big Ben.
One smuggler even claimed he would be able to make customers a British passport.
It comes as 27 people died while attempting to cross the Channel, one of the worst death tolls in recent years.
Apple sues spyware company NSO Group over alleged iPhone hacking
Apple said its lawsuit was sending a clear message: "In a free society, it is unacceptable to weaponise powerful state-sponsored spyware against those who seek to make the world a better place."
Apple has filed a lawsuit against NSO Group, the private spyware company which has been accused of providing despotic regimes with the tools to hack into the mobile phones of their critics.
The lawsuit, filed in Northern California on Tuesday, describes NSO Group as "amoral 21st century mercenaries" that develops technology which "invites routine and flagrant abuse" as detailed by Apple.
It follows a similar case launched by WhatsApp, and comes on the heels of the US government earlier this month sanctioning the Israeli business on the grounds that it allowed foreign governments "to maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers".
The Commerce Department explained the sanctions were "a part of the Biden-Harris administration's efforts to put human rights at the centre of US foreign policy, including by working to stem the proliferation of digital tools used for repression".
It followed the head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, Lindy Cameron, saying that the Pegasus Papers stories - linking the company's spyware tools to potentially thousands of victims - "demonstrated something we have raised a red flag about before; the commercial market for sophisticated cyber exploitation products".
Apple said its lawsuit was sending a clear message: "In a free society, it is unacceptable to weaponise powerful state-sponsored spyware against those who seek to make the world a better place."
The company added that it was notifying "the small number of users" who had been victimised by NSO Group's technology, potentially exposing abusive government practices.
What is the Online Safety Bill and why are some people worried about it?
A draft of the bill is being scrutinised before it is formally introduced to parliament.
While some have welcomed its provisions to protect children, others have criticised it as a "censor's charter".
Following the murder of Sir David Amess and an arrest after another MP was emailed a death threat, senior figures in Westminster are decrying the abuse directed towards politicians over the internet.
Parliament is currently scrutinising the proposed solution to these abusive messages, the draft Online Safety Bill, which aims to establish a new way to regulate online content - covering not just abusive messages but all harmful material online, from bullying through to pornography.
It has the support of England's Children's Commissioner and the NSPCC, but some are concerned the law will end up introducing more problems than it solves.
They have criticised the current draft for its potential to have a chilling effect on free speech and hand censorship powers to the government.
What does the Online Safety Bill aim to do?
The Online Safety Bill will introduce obligations on companies to keep their users safe.
That safety is defined in broad terms.
It covers material that is already illegal under English law (such as images of child abuse) as well as material that is considered legal but harmful.
Technology companies will also be required to protect their users' rights to freedom of expression and privacy.
Tesla: Hundreds locked out of cars after server outage
Some 500 users of Tesla electric cars were unable to connect to their vehicles, with Elon Musk saying the company's mobile application "should be coming back online now".
Around 500 Tesla car owners were unable to connect to their vehicles due to an app server outage.
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, said on Friday that the company's mobile application was coming back online after the outage.
He tweeted in response to a Tesla owner who said he was experiencing a "500 server error" in connecting his Model 3 through the iOS app in Seoul, South Korea.
"Should be coming back online now," Mr Musk said.
"Looks like we may have accidentally increased verbosity of network traffic."
Around 500 Tesla users reported facing an error around 9.40pm GMT, according to outage monitoring website Downdetector.
There were over 60 reports as of 2.20am GMT.
Retailers putting up prices at fastest pace since 1990 as consumers splash out early for Christmas
A CBI report found that "Christmas seems to have come early" for stores with shoppers looking to stock up for the festive season for fear of missing out due to supply chain snags.
Retailers are putting up prices at the fastest rate since 1990 according to industry figures that add to evidence of a cost of living squeeze this winter.
A CBI survey also suggested that sales have been boosted by consumers starting their Christmas shopping early because of fears over supply disruption.
Clothing and department stores saw "big upward swings" in November, the report found.
The figures, while providing cheer for high streets, also represent the latest sign of households facing bigger spending outlays after surging energy bills and fuel costs drove inflation to its highest level in a decade last month.
In the three months to November, the balance of retailers reporting higher selling prices stood at +77%, according to the CBI.
That was the highest level since May 1990.
Prices are expected to rise at a broadly similar pace next month, the survey added.
The Weeknd knocks Chubby Checker off Billboard's all-time song chart with viral hit Blinding Lights
Billboard's methodology is based around the company's weekly Hot 100 chart (which began in 1958), and gives an inverse weighting based on their performance throughout history - meaning the longer you spend in the chart, the higher the score.
Chubby Checker's The Twist has been knocked off its perch at the top of Billboard's all-time greatest song chart by The Weeknd's viral hit Blinding Lights.
Checker's 1960 hit has been atop the table since its inception in 2008, after spending several weeks at number one in the 60s.
Canadian artist The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye), released Blinding Lights in 2019, with the track quickly going viral on TikTok and climbing up the streaming charts.
The singer also closed with the track at his Super Bowl half-time show earlier this year, while an army of dancers joined him on the pitch in Tampa.
Blinding Lights spent four weeks at number one on the weekly Billboard Hot 100 (equivalent to the UK's Top 40), going on to spend 43 weeks in the top five, 57 in the top 10 and 90 weeks in the chart overall.
Channel deaths: Migrants 'not scared' to travel to UK as dozens pictured waiting to cross day after tragedy
27 people die trying to cross the Channel; Priti Patel says she's "not heartless" for wanting to stop migrants reaching the UK this way; more desperate people arrive on boats this morning; President Macron calls for emergency meeting of European ministers.
Dave Chappelle doesn't back down when students at DC alma mater slam him as 'bigot' at surprise visit
Comedian Dave Chappelle made a surprise visit to his alma mater in Washington, D.C., where some students reportedly expected him to apologize following blowback over his popular "The Closer" comedy special on Netflix this year.
"I'm 16 and I think you're childish, you handled it like a child," a student said, adding that Chappelle is a "bigot," Politico Playbook reported Thursday after speaking to attendees of the event.
"My friend, with all due respect, I don’t believe you could make one of the decisions I have to make on a given day," he responded, according to students recounting the event.
Chappelle has faced years of backlash and claims that he is "transphobic" for jokes in his stand-up acts, including after "The Closer," where he made comments such as "gender is a fact," was released on Netflix last month.
The special was panned by the trans community and some employees of Netflix but boasts high ratings among general audiences.
He made an appearance at D.C.’s Duke Ellington School of the Arts on Tuesday, where 580 students packed the auditorium, according to Politico Playbook.
The comedian graduated from the school in 1991.
The school initially moved his appearance from Nov. 23 to April 22 over threats of students walking out in protest before apparently going back to the original plan.
Politico reported that he responded to another antagonistic question from a student: "I’m better than every instrumentalist, artist, no matter what art you do in this school, right now, I’m better than all of you.
I’m sure that will change.
I’m sure you’ll be household names soon."
"Your comedy kills," another student shouted at him.
Marine vet wounded by IED on Thanksgiving Day devotes holiday season to giving thanks to fellow troops
To most, Thanksgiving connotes a joyous time of family, food, and celebration.
But for Marine Sergeant Gabriel Martinez, the holiday marks a traumatic event that led to the loss of both his legs due to an injury he sustained while serving the U.S. abroad.
Martinez was on his second deployment when he stepped on an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Helmand Province in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 26, 2010, causing the amputations of both of his legs.
After an extensive recovery process, Martinez, now medically retired, has teamed up with Semper Fi & America's Fund to give back to his fellow veterans this holiday season.
"Semper Fi Fund and America's Fund has been part of my family now since the injury and I'm just one of the millions of veterans that they’ve been helping in mind, body, and spirit," Martinez told "Fox News Live" on Thanksgiving Day.
"Since I was wounded, they have provided assistance with just about any aspect they have.
So many generous Americans are willing to provide monetary value and support, so this time of year is specifically not only is it special for me, but for the fund," he said.
The non-profit 501 organization provides a variety of programs to assist wounded veterans in all branches of the United States Armed Forces.
The ‘Double Down for Veterans’ initiative, a dollar-for-dollar match system from the The Bob & Renee Parsons Foundation, is currently active until the end of the year, Martinez said.
Philadelphia marks 500th homicide in 2021 after woman fatally shot
Philadelphia hit a grim milestone Wednesday as the city experienced its 500th homicide of the year, one which has plagued multiple cities with increasing levels of violence following years of relative peace.
The latest killing involved a 55-year-old woman found by police officers shot multiple times around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday.
She later died at a hospital.
"Each and every homicide carries with it a profound sense of loss.
However, for our City to have reached such a tragic milestone - 500 lives cut short - it carries a weight that is almost impossible to truly comprehend," Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said in a statement.
Mayor Jim Kenney, a Democrat, blamed the uptick in violence on the flow of illegal guns into the city and chided state lawmakers for not doing enough to enact tighter gun laws.
"The volume of guns that are in circulation in our communities is at a record-high," he said while surrounded by city leaders and community members at a Wednesday news conference.
"[Crime guns] join a sea of illegal and legal guns that are accessible in the heat of the moment, turning what could have stayed an argument into a homicide."
"It's all about greed.
There are people making money selling these guns and the Legislature, not the people behind me, don't care," he added.
"They don't care how many people get killed.
It's ridiculous."
Thanksgiving canceled?
Liberals who say America's holiday promotes genocide and White supremacy
Liberal pundits and news outlets across the country are using Thanksgiving week to disparage the holiday and label it a function of White supremacy and genocide.
"What is Thanksgiving to Indigenous people?
'A day of mourning'" a USA Today headline on Tuesday said, accompanied by an article that claimed "many" Americans believe the holiday "represents the dark shadow of genocide."
A weather service, Currently, posted an article Tuesday suggesting that Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving are "hurting" the Native American community.
"Thanksgiving will be celebrated by many people across the country," the tweet said.
"The holiday perpetuates in a false narrative, that spins the true history of genocide and colonization into a light and largely false story."
On MSNBC over the weekend, Gyasi Ross, who is Native American, explained a segment that white people have created a fake story around Thanksgiving and that the pilgrims are responsible for a system of White supremacy that is used to carry out "state sponsored" violence against Black people to this day.
Seth Rogen goes viral after shrugging off Los Angeles car burglaries: 'It’s called living in a big city'
Comedic actor Seth Rogen sparked a Twitter frenzy after he shrugged off Los Angeles criminals breaking into cars, suggesting it's simply part of normal life in a big city.
The viral uproar began when the "Knocked Up" star reacted to a tweet from YouTube personality Casey Neistat, who wrote on Wednesday, "so our cars got robbed this morning because Los Angeles is a crime riddled 3rd world s---hole of a city" and expressed gratitude towards the LA Police Department for arresting the criminal and retrieving all the stolen belongings.
"Dude I’ve lived here for over 20 years.
You’re nuts haha," Rogen reacted.
"It’s lovely here.
Don’t leave anything valuable in it.
It’s called living in a big city."
"i can still be mad tho right?"
Neistat asked, adding, "feel so violated."
"You can be mad but I guess I don’t personally view my car as an extension of myself and I’ve never really felt violated any of the 15 or so times my car was broken in to," Rogen responded.
"Once a guy accidentally left a cool knife in my car so if it keeps happening you might get a little treat."
Kamala Harris reportedly spent over $500 on cookware in Parisian shop amid US economic uncertainty
Vice President Kamala Harris spent over $500 on cookware in a Parisian shop amid rising inflation and economic uncertainty at home in the U.S.
The vice president visited the shop on her four-day diplomatic trip to Paris last week, reportedly dropping 516 euros on pots and pans at high-end cookware store E. Dehillerin.
The store is located outside of the world-famous Louvre museum, where the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, the Mona Lisa, hangs.
Harris took home a serving dish costing around $375, a frying pan around $160, as well as a multitude of other kitchenware items, including a porcelain egg dish and a copper cleaner, according to the store, which disclosed the amount of the purchase to the Washington Free Beacon.
By comparison, a Mauviel copper saucepan carried by luxury brand Williams Sonoma -- based in Harris’ home state of California – is priced between $200 and $285.
After her stop into E. Dehillerin, Harris was asked by reporters about how her trip to France has prepared her for the presidency.
The vice president, who looked at the reporter with an expression of surprise, did not directly answer the question but instead touted the success of her diplomatic mission.
"I will tell you it was a very productive and a good trip," she said, adding that the U.S. has "a lot of follow up to do."
COVID-19: Total number of cases in UK passes 10 million since start of pandemic
The latest government data also revealed another 147 people have died with COVID.
The number of COVID cases the UK has seen since the start of the pandemic has passed 10 million, official figures show.
According to government data, the number of people to have tested positive in the latest round of daily figures is 47,240.
Today's data also showed that another 147 people have died with COVID.
The figures also showed the cases reported between November 19 and November 25 were up by 9.5% compared with the previous seven days.
A further 147 people were also reported as having died within 28 days of a positive test for COVID, meaning the seven-day total was down by 14.8% from the previous week.
Meanwhile, a total of 50,852,133 first doses of the COVID vaccine had been delivered in the UK by November 24, which was a rise of 24,579 on yesterday.
Around 46,232,258 second doses were also delivered, which was an increase of 23,439.
A total of 16,383,575 booster and third doses were given out too, a day-on-day rise of 378,946.
The latest figures come as Europe struggles with its latest COVID wave.
Earlier today, the Czech government declared a state of emergency for 30 days due to a surge in cases, while Germany hit 100,000 COVID-related deaths.
Outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference: "The day on which we must mourn 100,000 victims of the coronavirus is a sad one."
In France, authorities announced that booster shots would be made available to everyone aged over 18, rather than just the over-65s and those with underlying health issues, in a bid to tackle the ongoing crisis.
Fairfax County schools reinstates books with explicit images, claiming they don't include pedophilia
Fairfax County Public Schools reinstated two books that parents have condemned as obscene and pedophilic, claiming that two committees of school administrators, librarians, parents, and students determined that the books did not contain pedophilia and did not violate regulations by including obscene material.
Parents condemned the move in comments to Fox News.
"Lawn Boy" by Jonathan Evison includes long sections of a boy reminiscing about explicit experiences he had at 10 years old and "Gender Queer: A Memoir," by Maia Kobabe includes photos of sexual acts between a boy and a man.
Fairfax County Public Schools announced that it had restored the books to libraries after two committees reviewed them.
One committee found that "Lawn Boy" includes themes that "are affirming for students" with marginalized identities.
"There is no pedophilia in the book," the committee added.
The other committee found that "Gender Queer" depicts "difficulties nonbinary and asexual individuals may face."
The committee concluded that "the book neither depicts nor describes pedophilia."
"The robust committee process took place over several weeks and considered whether the books flouted regulations by being obscene or harmful to juveniles as defined by the Code of Virginia," FCPS noted in the press release.
"After careful consideration, neither books were deemed to have fallen foul of these regulations."
Stacy Langton, the Fairfax County mother who confronted the school board with images from the books in September, told Fox News that the FCPS report is "very intellectually dishonest."
"Unless FCPS is using a different dictionary, pedophilia means adults having sex with children, and that is precisely what is being depicted in the particular panel in Gender Queer," Langton told Fox News in an interview on Tuesday.
Waukesha parade attack: Meet the official who agreed to $1K bail for Darrell Brooks ahead of Christmas carnage
Waukesha parade suspect Darrell Brooks’ release on just $1,000 bail weeks before the deadly attack prompted Milwaukee’s district attorney to announce an investigation into his own office’s request for such a low sum.
But it was a court commissioner, not a low-level prosecutor, who agreed and cleared the way for Brooks' release.
Court documents identify Cedric Cornwall as the commissioner present at Brooks' arraignment.
He did not respond to emails seeking an explanation, and no one picked up multiple calls to a phone listed under his name.
Numerous experts, including former prosecutors, police officers and defense attorneys, told Fox News Digital that Brooks’ bail seemed too low for the crime: allegedly punching a woman, stealing her phone and running her over with the same SUV believed to have been used weeks later to cause carnage at a family-oriented holiday parade.
He also had charges for another firearms felony pending an active warrant out of Nevada and a record of skipping bail.
Men found guilty in Arbery murder will go to federal court on hate crime charges
The legal troubles for the three men found guilty in the murder Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia court are far from over, as the trio will face federal hate crime and kidnapping charges next year.
Travis McMichael, 35, his father, Gregory McMichael, 65, and their neighbor William "Roddie" Bryan, 52, all faced nine criminal counts in the Georgia state court: one count of malice murder, four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, one count of false imprisonment and one count of criminal attempt to commit a felony.
Travis McMichael was found guilty on Wednesday on all nine counts in the February 2020 murder of Arbery, a Black man, in Georgia.
Gregory McMichael was found not guilty on one count of malice murder and guilty on the other charges.
Bryan was found not guilty of one count of malice murder, one count of felony murder and one count of aggravated assault, and guilty on the other charges.
How weather affects what's on Thanksgiving's menu
If you've ever wondered how the weather affects what you're serving up for Thanksgiving, FOX Weather has you covered.
And if you're looking for something to talk about at the dinner table this year, be sure to download the FOX Weather app and check out 7 Thanksgiving Day table conversation starters from FOX Weather!
1. The holiday season is upon us, which means more pies, especially favorites like pecan pie.
And no matter how you pronounce it, this year's pecan crop brought good news for U.S. home bakers and businesses.
2. Cranberries are one of three fruits native to the United States, and they're only harvested in five states - Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin and Oregon.
FOX Weather Multimedia Journalist Katie Byrne went to New Jersey to see how the crop is harvested every year and how the weather can significantly impact the crop.
3. It's tough to be a turkey around Thanksgiving, but one thing the big birds don't have going against them is drowning in the rain when they look up to the sky.
It's purely gobble gossip.
4.
Sunday evening marks the beginning of Hanukkah.
After the Jews fought to reclaim the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, they found only one day's worth of olive oil to use for the daily menorah lighting.
Miraculously, that small amount of oil burned for eight straight nights.
And since then, olive oil has continued to benefit not only lighting menorahs but also heart health.
But with recent weather extremes, the state with the largest production of olives has been feeling the effects.
5. Did you know that the nation's largest pumpkin producer could have been wiped out this year?
Availability of the popular pumpkin pie filling may have been saved after an Illinois crop scientist discovered a water mold.
6. Whether they're topped with marshmallows or covered in brown sugar and cinnamon, yams are a staple side dish for Thanksgiving.
And if you like them or not, the age-old question remains: What's the difference between a yam and a sweet potato?
See the pictures: US troops far from home celebrate Thanksgiving across the world
President Biden thanked U.S. service members and commemorated those who have lost their lives while serving their country in a Thanksgiving Day proclamation Wednesday.
"You know, as we gather together again, our table and our hearts are full of grace and gratitude for all those we love," the president said in a video message with first lady Jill Biden.
"And as Commander-in-Chief, I’m especially grateful to our service members and their families for their sacrifices to our nation."
The first lady noted that many military families will not be able to celebrate the holiday together and expressed gratitude for their service to America.
"While we celebrate together, many of those military families will be apart from those loved ones," Jill Biden said.
"Whether your spouse is deployed or you’ve settled into yet another base, the holidays just aren’t the same without the people and the communities that make this holiday special.
We are so grateful for your service."
Nick Saban tries to tamp down 'self-absorbed' fans' high expectations
Nick Saban had a very blunt response to a fan question during his radio show on Wednesday and took to task the expectation that Alabama is supposed to blow out every team it plays.
The fan asked why the Crimson Tide weren’t blowing teams out with high expectations, citing the recent 42-35 victory over Arkansas.
Bryce Young set a school record in that game with 559 passing yards along with five touchdowns.
Saban wasn’t sure why a win and being in the top four of the College Football Playoff ranking wasn’t good enough for fans at this point in the season.
"When I came here everybody was happy to win a game.
Now we’re not happy to win a game anymore.
We’re not happy to win a game at all.
We think we should win games by whatever, and I don’t think that’s fair to the players either.
Because our players work their butt off to be the best they can be.
And to get criticized for what they work hard for to do so that you can be entertained, so you can enjoy and have pride and passion for what they accomplish and what they do," Saban said.
"And they’re not perfect.
They’re just college students.
They go to school every day, they have to study, they have to run extra after practice when they miss study hall."
Saban added fans should have some type of gratitude and know that nobody wants to win more than his players.
"So for all you self-absorbed folks out there that can’t look past your own self to appreciate what other people are doing," he said.
Saban took over the Alabama job for Mike Shula after the 2006 season.
Since then, the Crimson Tide have been one of the most dominant college football teams in the sport’s history.
WWE star Seth Rollins describes 'terrifying' fan attack
WWE superstar Seth Rollins said the fan attack at Raw on Monday night was a "terrifying" experience.
Rollins was walking to the back after a match with Finn Balor at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, when a fan came out of nowhere and speared him.
The fan was quickly tackled by referees and security and removed from the arena.
The man was identified as Elisah Spencer, 24, and he was charged with two offenses.
Rollins recalled the attack in an interview with TMZ Sports on Tuesday.
"It happened very quickly.
I was mostly just reacting and hoping that our security would come and do their job.
Which they did very quickly.
And then was just trying to detach and move on.
Hope that everybody is OK," he said.
The NYPD said Rollins suffered a swolen lip.
"No, no serious injuries.
Nothing like that.
I was safe, we were safe.
Everything was OK," he added.
Spencer, of Brooklyn, is accused of leaving his seating section and jumping the barrier to attack Rollins.
He faces charges of attempted assault and attempted violation of arts and cultural affairs (disrupting live sporting event), police said.
10 common cryptocurrency terms you need to know
Despite Bitcoin launching way back in 2009, it’s only until recently that you can’t turn on the news or browse the web without coming across some mention of cryptocurrency.
I got so many questions from my readers and national radio show listeners that I wrote an eBook about crypto to help.
I demystify digital currency, mining, and how to get started trading.
Tap or click here to get your copy on Amazon.
Sadly, I also hear from people that got fooled by one crypto scam or another.
Where there is money, criminals are waiting.
Tap or click for five clever crypto scams making the rounds right now and steps to stay safe.
Before we get started, know this is not financial advice.
The crypto world is volatile, and you should never risk money you aren't comfortable losing.
Now, let's take a look at some of the most common lingo.
1. Blockchain
Every cryptocurrency transaction is processed, verified, and recorded on a virtual ledger known as a blockchain.
When time someone buys or sells using cryptocurrency, another entry is made on this virtual ledger.
Think of the blockchain as a series of boxcars from a train.
When a cryptocurrency transaction is made, another boxcar gets added to the train.
The blockchain is decentralized.
This means it’s not stored on one machine or even across one network.
Instead, the blockchain exists on computers all over the world that are accessible because of the internet.
People and companies help verify each transaction that gets added to the blockchain using their own computer’s processing power on a decentralized peer-to-peer network.
Each transaction is timestamped, individually encrypted, and cannot be reversed or changed.
Yes, you read that right — crypto transactions cannot be reversed.

You'll also hear firsthand from a crypto miner, too.
2. Fiat
I know what you’re thinking: "I thought a Fiat was a car."
Not in crypto-land.
Fiat money is government-issued currency.
If you’re in the United States, that means the U.S. dollar.
Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, is virtual money.
Cryptocurrencies aren’t backed by governments or any other standard used with traditional currency.
Each "token" represents the amount you own.
How much each token is worth varies based on the current market value.
One day it's up; the next day down.
With cryptocurrency, the price fluctuations can happen much faster and are more extreme — both positive and negative.
A good resource to check the current prices is CoinMarketCap.
3. Altcoin
Here’s an easy one to remember.
An altcoin is any digital currency that’s not Bitcoin.
There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, with new ones being added all the time.
At the time of this writing, these are the five currencies with the highest market caps.
(That is the total market value of the circulating supply.)
Since crypto moves so fast, this list may have already changed by the time you’re reading.

Those involved in the protest say it is a response to the UK's "provocative, contemptuous and humiliating attitude towards them".
French fishermen will attempt to block the Channel Tunnel and the port of Calais tomorrow in protest at the UK's failure to grant them more fishing licences since Brexit.
Members of the fishermen's association said a large number of vehicles would be used to block the tunnel, which is used to ship goods by rail between Britain and France.
London and Paris are in dispute over the number of licences the UK has allocated to French boats to allow them to fish in British waters since the UK left the European Union.
France - and its fishermen - say many more licences should have been granted and that frustration is mounting.
The UK insists it is respecting the post-Brexit arrangements.
"This is our demonstration of the quality and ability of professional fishermen to mobilise in response to the UK's provocative, contemptuous and humiliating attitude towards them," said Gerard Romiti, President of National Maritime Fisheries Committee.
A Downing Street spokesman said the government is "disappointed by threats of protest activity".
They continued: "It will be a matter for the French to ensure that there are no illegal actions and that trade is not affected.
We continue to monitor the situation closely."
It is not the first time French fishermen have sought to take direct action.
In April, they blocked lorries carrying fish from British waters to processing centres in France.
And the British navy dispatched two patrol boats in May when French boats blockaded the Saint Helier harbour in Jersey.
France and the UK have also exchanged criticism over the deaths of 27 migrants who drowned when they attempted to cross the Channel in an inflatable dinghy on Wednesday.
A spokesperson for the Port of Dover said they were aware of the potential for a "limited period of disruption in France".
The person added: "The port will be open for business as normal, and has tried and tested plans in place to deal with temporary interruptions to cross-Channel services should they occur.
"We would encourage any customers travelling tomorrow to allow some extra time for their journey and check with their chosen ferry operator for the latest updates."
Demonizing Black victims is an old racist trope that didn't work for defense attorneys this time
Ahmaud Arbery was the victim.
But for weeks, he was painted as a brute and a thug in the trial of the three White men who killed him.
This tactic isn't new, but rather the latest example in a long history of court cases that criminalize and dehumanize Black victims.
Emmett Till.
Jordan Davis.
Trayvon Martin.
Botham Jean.
George Floyd -- all of them Black, all of them victims, just as Arbery was.
Arbery's family can now feel a sense of justice after Gregory McMichael, Travis McMichael and William "Roddie" Bryan Jr. were convicted on Wednesday, but that outcome is a rare exception to the rule.
"I wouldn't want to see no daddy watch their kid get lynched and shot down like that.
So it's all our problem.
Let's keep fighting.
Let's keep doing and making this a better place for all human beings.
All human beings," Marcus Arbery Sr. said after the reading of the verdict.
Race and racial tensions were clearly on display inside and outside the Georgia courtroom where the three men were tried, even as both the defense and the prosecution shied away from those discussions.
Instead, the jury heard from the defense a number of racist dog whistles.
From assertions that Black pastors might frighten jurors to a remark about Arbery's "long, dirty toenails," the defense's strategy was rife with rhetoric that sought to dehumanize and devalue Black Americans.
"What I saw was the defense preying on White fears," said Carol Anderson, a historian and the chair of African American studies at Emory University.
"The 'long, dirty toenails' -- that is an old trope of the 'Black Beast.'
That is the stuff coming out of Reconstruction and Jim Crow."
Who is Zhang Gaoli?
The man at the center of Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai's #MeToo allegation
Before retiring as vice premier, Zhang Gaoli was the face of China's organizing efforts ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics.
As the head of a government working group on the Beijing Games, Zhang inspected venue construction sites, visited athletes, unveiled official emblems, and held meeting after meeting to coordinate preparation work.
He received International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach at the leadership compound in the Chinese capital in 2016, promising to make the Games "fantastic, extraordinary and excellent."
But now, three years into his retirement and less than three months before the Olympics, Zhang has found himself at the center of an explosive #MeToo scandal that has prompted global uproar -- amplifying calls for a boycott of the Games that he helped organize.
Zhang, 75, was accused earlier this month by Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai, 35, of sexual assault at his home after he retired three years ago.
The two-time Grand Slam doubles champion also alleged a relationship with Zhang over an intermittent period that spanned at least a decade.
"Why did you have to come back to me, took me to your home to force me to have sex with you?"
Peng alleged in a since-deleted social media post dated November 2.
"I know that for someone of your eminence, Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, you said you were not afraid.
But even if it's just me, like an egg hitting the stone, a moth flying into flames, courting self-destruction, I would tell the truth about us," she wrote.
Germany is giving nearly two million workers a 25% pay rise
Almost 2 million workers in Europe's biggest economy are set for a big pay rise.
Three German political parties agreed to form a new government on Wednesday, with left-leaning Social Democrat Olaf Scholz set to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor following lengthy coalition negotiations.
As part of the coalition agreement, the country plans to raise its minimum wage to €12 ($13.46) an hour, from the current rate of €9.60 ($10.77) an hour.
The move could boost the income of nearly 2 million people in Germany who earn minimum wage salaries, or about 5% of workers, according to Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING.
He said the move was "clearly significant."
The minimum wage was already set to rise to €10.45 ($11.72) in July 2022.
The text of the coalition deal did not state when the bigger one-off increase will take effect.
UBS economist Felix Huefner said the move should "boost overall wage growth" across the German economy, while warning it could "contribute to broader wage pressures."
Germany's hawkish central bank took the unusual step of publicly criticizing the measure this week, calling it "worrying."
It said it would have a knock-on effect on wages for higher earners.
Inflationary pressure
Economists and policymakers around the world have been closely watching rising wages as a key component of inflation. In Germany, inflation in October stood at 4.5%, the highest measure in almost three decades, as energy prices shot up and the cost of food climbed.
Germany first introduced a national minimum wage of €8.50 ($9.54) in 2015.
Support for minimum wages in Europe has grown as the power of labor unions has declined.
The European Commission says there was a drop in the proportion of EU workers covered by collective bargaining agreements between 2000 and 2015, with particularly strong declines seen in central and eastern Europe.
A new draft EU law announced earlier this month looks to bolster minimum wages across the bloc with new requirements.
"During the previous crisis, lowering minimum wages and dismantling sectoral collective bargaining was the harsh medicine prescribed to many member states," EU Parliament member Agnes Jongerius, who sponsored the measure, said in a statement.
"Now, we are fighting to increase statutory minimum wages and to strengthen collective bargaining in Europe."
Germany's minimum wage is already among the highest in the European Union.
Ikea is offering a tiny apartment in Tokyo for less than $1 per month
Swedish retailer Ikea is becoming a landlord in Japan with a tiny apartment it will rent out in Tokyo.
The 10-square-meter (107-square-foot) apartment is located in the Shinjuku district and will cost just 99 yen ($0.86) per month to rent, according to details released by Ikea this week.
Only one unit is available, and it is fully furnished with Ikea furniture and accessories.
The company is accepting applications from potential tenants, who must be over 20 years old, until December 3.
The apartment will then be rented out with a lease through January 15, 2023, said Ikea.
The tenant will have to pay their own utility bills.
Ten square meters isn't much, but Ikea say they have worked hard to make the most of the available area.
"One of the keys is to make good use of the vertical space," the company said on its website.
"By capturing the room three-dimensionally, new possibilities open up in a limited space."
Tokyo is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, driving a trend for micro apartments.
It is home to just over 14 million people, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.
Ikea is promoting its tiny home with the help of a shark named Blahaj, who features in a series of promotional videos published on YouTube.
UK Michelin star restaurant burns down
A Michelin-star restaurant in northern England housed in a 14th century building has suffered significant damage after its thatched roof caught fire.
The Star Inn at Harome caught fire at 10.13 p.m. local time (5.13 p.m. ET) on Wednesday, according to the North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
The restaurant, which is located in the village of Harome in the county of North Yorkshire, posted about the incident on social media.
"We are devastated to let everyone know that there has been a fire in our restaurant and pub that has been burning throughout the night," wrote the restaurant in a Facebook post, adding that "thankfully no one was hurt."
Staff also posted on Twitter.
"It's been a long night so far.....I'm afraid we won't be open for a while as we are reduced to ashes," reads one tweet, which includes a short video of firefighters working to control the flames.
Fire crews from North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service used nine fire trucks, an aerial ladder platform and other equipment to battle the blaze, according to a statement.
"The fire in the thatched roof of the building caused extensive damage to the roof and roof space," it said.
"Crews worked hard to prevent the fire spreading all along the thatched roof, meaning one end of the roof and the ground floor were saved from the fire."
The service confirmed that all occupants were out of the property when crews arrived.
The cause of the fire is not yet known.
Keanu Reeves 'married under the eyes of God' to Winona Ryder
Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder may be one of Hollywood's longest standing "marriages."
Reeves has once again addressed talk that he and Ryder are actually married, thanks to actual priests officiating the wedding scene performed in Romania for the 1992 Francis Ford Coppola directed drama "Bram Stoker's Dracula."
"We did a whole take of a marriage ceremony with real priests," Reeves said in an Esquire video.
"Winona says we are [married].
Coppola says we are.
So I guess we're married... under the eyes of God."
Back in 2018, the two actors talked to Entertainment Weekly while promoting their rom-com "Destination Wedding," and Ryder said she believed that the pair had wed.
"In that scene, Francis [Ford Coppola] used a real Romanian priest," she said.
"We shot the master and he did the whole thing.
So I think we're married."
Ryder had to remind Reeves that they had done the entire ceremony, including saying "I do."
"Don't you remember that?," Ryder asked Reeves.
"It was on Valentine's Day."
"Oh my gosh, we're married," Reeves replied.
How a love for big cats and the 'myth' of the leopard sparked this wildlife photographer's career
People travel across oceans and from the other side of the world for a chance to see the wonders of Kruger National Park.
The South African game reserve was established more than 120 years ago and ranks among the best national parks in the world.
Bucket-list adventurers visit with the hope of encountering the "big five" -- lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos and buffalo -- and, with any luck, capturing a memory-worthy photo in the process.
"Our animals basically make wildlife photography fashionable," says Rodney Nombekana, a safari guide who prides himself on giving visitors a camera roll of reasons to fall in love with Kruger's wildlife.
"By doing so, not only do they appreciate the wildlife but they also get involved in conservation of our natural world."
Tourists on Nombekana's safaris may well find themselves in a prime position to capture the perfect shot -- because Nombekana is a wildlife photographer himself, a passion he says he fell into years ago while leading a safari group through a different park.
"It just so happened that a leopard was sitting on a beautiful rock during the sunset, and I took out my cell phone and I took a picture of this leopard," Nombekana recalls.
"When I got home, I looked at the picture, and I realized that it would be nice if taken from a proper camera."
So Nombekana bought a starter camera kit.
As with the leopard, he found himself drawn to capturing images of big cats -- a fascination he says was likely sparked during his childhood in the rural areas of the Eastern Cape.
"The elders of the village always told us about the leopard," he explains.
"It was always a myth that there was this animal that was called a leopard.
We actually never really saw it.
It's always been a dream of mine to actually see a leopard in the wild and when I first saw one, it was just unbelievable."
How close are we to guilt-free flying?
Gleaming airplanes have been returning to the empty blue skies above 30,000 feet in recent months, opening up travel possibilities as they skim the clouds on their way towards unfiltered sunshine.
On board, safely behind face masks, many passengers have been shrugging off the old discomforts of plane travel in their excitement at being in the air again.
Airline food has never tasted so good.
And yet, something is leaving a bitter taste.
The world is a changed place since we were last exploring it, and one of the main changes is the heightened concern we have for the damage we've been causing to it through activities such as flying.
Aviation generates 2.8% of global CO2 emissions and, even before the recent COP26 climate talks, has become a lightning rod for the "flight shame" movement.
On the heels of the climate summit agreement by 200 countries to slash greenhouse emissions by 2030, the industry has been steeling itself for a crisis as more and more people raise concerns over the impact of air travel.
Numerous airlines have already pledged to offer carbon-neutral travel and explore alternative fuels to reduce pollution.
Developments in electric airplanes, though still a distant possibility for long-haul flight, have also raised hopes for green air travel.
Net-zero carbon emissions by 2050
So how close are we to guilt-free and genuinely low-impact flying?
It's definitely a priority for the industry.
At its annual meeting in October, IATA, the International Air Transport Association, rubber stamped a resolution in support of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
That's a tall order.
It's anticipated that 10 billion people will be flying annually by 2050, which by today's emission standards means that the aviation industry will need to deal with a cumulative total of 21.2 gigatons of carbon over the next three decades.
IATA reckons that figure won't be quite so high as some emissions will be mitigated through the adoption of cleaner energy sources and better airplane design.
"A potential scenario is that 65% of [carbon] will be abated through sustainable aviation fuels," Willie Walsh, the former British Airways boss who is now IATA's director general, said in a press release.
Sustainable fuels, made from materials such as wood residue deposits, tobacco or sugarcane, can already be used in many of today's newer jet engines without any modification.
Walsh says new propulsion tech, including hydrogen, will take care of another 13% while efficiency improvements will account for a further 3%.
The remainder, he says, could be dealt with "through carbon capture and storage and offsets."
Samsung will create 2,000 jobs in Texas with $17 billion chip factory
Samsung is planning to build a $17 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility in Texas as part of efforts to tackle a global shortage of chips.
Announcing its largest ever investment in the United States, the South Korean electronics giant said Tuesday that the factory would create 2,000 high-tech jobs directly, and thousands more in the local economy once it is in full operation.
The facility is expected to begin operations in the second half of 2024
"With greater manufacturing capacity, we will be able to better serve the needs of our customers and contribute to the stability of the global semiconductor supply chain," Kinam Kim, Vice Chairman and CEO of Samsung Electronics, said in a statement.
The company said that it chose the city of Taylor in Texas for its new plant based on multiple factors, including its proximity to Samsung's current manufacturing site in Austin, the local semiconductor ecosystem, and government support.
The Taylor site will span more than 5 million square meters and is expected to serve as a key location for Samsung's global semiconductor manufacturing capacity, along with its latest new production line in Pyeongtaek, South Korea.
Samsung's announcement comes at a time when the Biden administration has been pushing semiconductor production and research in the United States.
Although the current worldwide shortage of computer chips is primarily driven by the impact of the pandemic, extreme weather events that have hampered production and other factors, the United States has been lagging behind other producers for years.
What is the future of the cop drama?
Crime dramas and police procedurals are some of the most popular types of TV, but with trust in authorities waning and audience expectations changing, what could be the future of the genre?
You know this scene, you've watched it a thousand times before: the maverick police officer, who breaks the rules but gets the job done, hands over their badge to a disgruntled superior.
This trope has been hardwired into the TV cop drama, or police procedural, one of television's oldest and most dominant genres, which accounts for (according to research undertaken in 2020 by The Hollywood Reporter) almost a fifth of all scripted series on US network television.
It is also hugely popular elsewhere, with dramas like Line of Duty and Vigil booming in popularity in the UK.
In almost every example of the "hand over your badge" scene, the audience is asked to sympathise not with the by-the-book boss – insisting on accountability and due process – but the protocol-breaking cop.
The conditioning of viewers to root for the law-enforcing protagonist, no matter what, speaks to one of many problems some see as endemic in the cop drama: the vast majority of these productions offering flattering depictions of the police.
Stressed by parenting?
Evolution can explain why
What can ants and meerkats teach us about parenting?
Evolutionary biologist Nichola Raihani uncovers the ancient social instincts that still shape our families today.
I wrestled the remote control off my children and perched on the sofa, bracing myself for what was coming.
It was March 2020, and caseloads of a novel and dangerous coronavirus were rising quickly here in the UK.
Our Prime Minister was about to announce a lockdown.
Schools and nurseries were going to close.
Like millions of other parents, I was about to become my young children's de facto school teacher.
The idea filled me with dread.
I wasn't the only one feeling that way.
My phone buzzed as messages flooded the school WhatsApp channel, with parents wondering how they were going to fit the demands of their day jobs around fronted adverbials and long division.
Over the months that followed, many parents felt a crushing toll on their mental and physical health.
More lockdowns and school closures ensued, along with reports of a worrying increase in levels of parental stress, anxiety and depression.
Many asked themselves why this was so hard.
Shouldn't we be naturally good at raising our young without outside help?
Didn't humans cope without schools and daycare in the past, after all?
As an evolutionary biologist, I do not hold the answers to all pandemic-related family crises, but I can say one thing for certain: as a species, humans are spectacularly ill-equipped to deal with parenting in isolation.
Should young children be made to wear face masks?
In Singapore and many other countries around the world, it's common for young children to wear masks against Covid-19 – but aside from the protection they provide against the virus, might they pose a risk to their longer-term development?
Like many children his age, three-year-old Eshan Evans is energetic and boisterous.
But as soon as he has to put on a face mask at school, something changes.
"You can see he's a different boy, much tamer and quieter," says his mother Herne.
In Singapore, where Eshan and his family live, children aged six and above are legally required to wear masks.
But many kindergartens and pre-schools also strongly encourage the practice for younger children.
It means that for roughly eight hours every weekday, except while eating, drinking, or napping, Eshan wears a disposable three-ply mask.
The moment he's let out, however, he rips off his mask, shoving it into his pocket or thrusting into his grandmother's hands.
Once, on a particularly bad day in July, he threw his mask on the ground and ran out the school gates.
"He hates it," says his mother, who doesn't make her son wear a mask outside of school.
"I have nothing against masks... but we don't want to force it on him and know he's uncomfortable."
The decision of whether to mask young children is one that many parents and regulators around the world are facing as they try to prevent new waves of Covid-19, while also allowing children to develop, socialise and thrive emotionally.
From a regulatory standpoint, as of early October, countries fall largely into three camps.
Singapore and European countries such as France and Italy recommend masking up from the age of six.
This is in line the World Health Organization's guidelines, which recommend that children over six wear masks in certain circumstances, for example when there is widespread transmission in their area.
Some only apply the rule to specific indoor settings, such as school.
Other regulatory bodies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, recommend mask-wearing for those aged two and older.
And then there are those countries that have dropped requirements for in-classroom face coverings – for instance, in the UK, neither children nor their teachers are advised to wear masks to school.

Death toll soars to 52 in Russian coal mine accident - reports
At least 52 people are reported to have died in Russia's worst mining disaster in a decade.
The incident started when coal dust in a ventilation shaft caught fire on Thursday, filling the Siberian mine with smoke and killing 11.
By nightfall, a failed operation to reach dozens of missing miners had turned to tragedy after several rescuers reportedly suffocated.
An emergency services source told one news agency "no one is left alive".
The majority of the 285 people in the the Listvyazhnaya mine, in the Kemerovo region some 3,500km (2,175 miles) east of Moscow, escaped in the immediate aftermath of the incident, at around 08:35 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday.
Officials said 49 had been taken to hospital with injuries.
Some of the injured have smoke poisoning, and four are said to be in a critical condition.
Dozens of miners were unable to escape after the initial incident, but rescue operations had to be suspended after dangerously high levels of methane were detected in the mine, prompting fears of possible explosions.
One of the rescue teams then failed to emerge from the mine.
The bodies of three rescuers were later found, bringing the official death toll to 14.
Then late on Thursday several sources told Russian media agencies that no further survivors were expected to be found and the death toll had risen to more than 50, including six rescuers in total.
Three people, including the mine director, have been arrested over alleged safety failings, Reuters news agency reports.
This is not the first accident at the mine, according to local media, with a methane gas explosion killing 13 in 2004.
More widely, accidents in Russian mines are not uncommon.
In 2016, authorities assessed the safety of the country's 58 coal mines and declared 34% of them potentially unsafe.
The list did not include the Listvyazhnaya mine at the time, Russian reports say.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said he hoped "(they) will be able to save as many people as possible", describing the loss of life as "a great tragedy".
House of Gucci and the trouble with extreme actor makeovers
Jared Leto's transformation into the older, balding Paolo Gucci has inspired both ridicule and irritation.
Are audiences tiring of actors' showy metamorphoses, asks Nicholas Barber.
Ridley Scott's lurid new true-crime drama, House of Gucci, chronicles the betrayal and murder that tore the Gucci fashion brand apart at the seams in the 1980s and 1990s.
The film's social-climbing anti-heroine is Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga), who pushes her diffident husband, Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), to take over the family business, even if that means ousting Maurizio's uncle Aldo (Al Pacino) and his cousin Paolo (Jared Leto).
Gaga is sure to be Oscar-nominated for her fiery performance.
Leto's performance, though, is another matter.
His woozy clowning, his sing-song mewling, and his ripe Italian accent belong in a sketch set in a pizza parlour on an old episode of The Muppet Show.
But, in his defence, his acting is no more eccentric than his hair and make-up.
Leto is probably better known for his sharp cheekbones, flowing flocks and all-round elfin prettiness than he is for his film roles, despite having won an Oscar.
But in House of Gucci, the actor and rock star is disguised as a designer with a sagging double chin, a bulbous nose, straggly grey sideburns, and a gleaming bald pate.
He is almost unrecognisable, so when images advertising the film went online in July, commentators were quick to praise him and the hair and make-up team for pulling off such an incredible feat.
The best Black Friday tech deals that are already available
While we've had weeks of early Black Friday deals already, Thanksgiving has brought additional sales, some of which we expect to continue through Black Friday proper.
This has been a trend for the past few years — if you happen to be online and searching for Black Friday deals a few hours before the day arrives, you can expect at least a handful of solid early sales.
And that strategy may pay off this year even more than others as supply chain issues continue to push back shipping estimates.
The sooner you grab the items on your gift list, the better the chance they'll arrive on time. To make your search a bit easier, we gathered the best early Black Friday tech deals we could find here.
Our favorite pair of Sony headphones, the WH-1000XM4, are down to $248 right now, which is just about $100 off their regular price.
We gave these cans a score of 94 for their powerful ANC, immersive sound quality and multi-device connectivity.
The updated AirPods Pro with the MagSafe case are on sale for $159 at Amazon and Walmart right now.
If you're a Sam's Club member, you can grab the Pros for $150 with $70 of Scan & Go Savings beginning on Black Friday.
These offer the best sound quality and fit of any of Apple's earbuds, and now they have a magnetic wireless charging case that's compatible with MagSafe accessories.
The 2021 Apple TV 4K is on sale for $160 right now
Streaming devices are pretty affordable nowadays, but there are some benefits to opting for a more expensive model like the Apple TV 4K.
We consider it to be the best high-end streaming box, and right now it's on sale for $160, which is one of the better prices we've seen.
Amazon has the device for $169, but an automatically applied coupon will knock the price down to $160 at checkout
Apple modestly upgraded its set-top box this year with the biggest improvement being the new Siri remote.
The previous remote that came with the Apple TV 4K was clunky to use, but this new model is a huge improvement.
It's larger and has a touch-sensitive directional pad that makes it much easier to swipe and scroll between content on your screen.
It's reminiscent of the iPod scrollwheel of yesteryear, and that's a good thing.
If you're familiar with the previous generation Apple TV 4K, you may not notice too much of a difference when it comes to performance.
The new model has an A12 Bionic chip that helps the gadget run smoothly, and we appreciate its support for Dolby Vision at 60 fps, Dolby Atmos sound and AirPlay 3.
This model even supports HomeKit, so you can ask Siri to show you things like video camera feeds and they'll pop up right on your TV screen.
We also found Siri to be quite useful for executing entertainment commands like "show me Christmas movies" or "play the latest episode of Ted Lasso."
The biggest drawback to the Apple TV 4K is price — it's normally $180, so it's worthwhile to wait for the (rare) sales in which it drops even slightly lower than that.
But it's by no means the only streaming box out there — we also like the Roku Ultra and, even though it's not technically a box, the latest Chromecast with Google TV is another solid option that also has an updated, handy remote.
Russia is investigating Netflix over LGBT content
Russian officials are investigating Netflix after the public commissioner for protecting families accused the company of violating a "gay propaganda" law, according to Reuters.
The commissioner claimed that some Netflix content with LGBTQIA+ themes was rated suitable for those aged 16 and older.
The country's laws do not allow the distribution of "propaganda on non-traditional sexual relations" among under 18s.
The Interior Ministry is said to be looking into the complaint.
If Netflix is deemed to have broken the law, it faces a fine of up to a million rubles ($13,390).
More significantly, the service could be temporarily suspended.
A Netflix source told Vedomosti the company didn't find any LGBT content that was rated 16+ during a review earlier in November.
The newspaper also reported this month that officials may ban streaming services from having shows and movies that depict "non-traditional sexual relationships and sexual deviations” in their libraries, including the likes of Fifty Shades of Gray and Billions.
The European Court of Human Rights determined in 2017 that the "propaganda" law, which was enacted in 2013, discriminates against LGBTQIA+ people and violates European treaty rules and the right to freedom of expression.
Activists and Western states have also criticized the regulation.
Meanwhile, Russia is taking aim at foreign tech companies at a broader level.
This week, it said the likes of Apple, Facebook parent Meta, Google, TikTok, Telegram and Twitter would need to set up official presences in the country by the end of the year, if they haven't already done so.
EU seeks to block political ads that target people's ethnicity or religion
The European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, has proposed a ban on some types of targeted political ads that employ sensitive personal data, including ethnic origin, religion, health status or sexual orientation, unless users give explicit consent.
If the rules come into force, advertisers would have to provide clear details on the criteria they use for targeting, as well as the "amplification tools or methods" they harness.
Every ad would also have to be more transparent in terms of displaying the name of the person or organization that paid for it, as well as disclosing how much was spent, where the money came from and the ad's connection to an election or referendum.
The EC is hoping these measures will help protect election integrity, largely by making it more difficult for campaigns to target and mislead marginalized groups.
It said people should be able to easily tell when they see a paid political ad, whether online or offline, and take part in political discussions without being impacted by interference, manipulation or misinformation.
