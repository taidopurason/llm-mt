Chief Justice: the government’s general orders must have limits
The government’s general orders, which have been used to set various restrictions and rules during the pandemic, should have limits to them, said the Chief Justice, Ivo Pilving.
"One of these limits we referred to, and even the Tallinn Circuit Court has referred to this, is that the government's general orders – which were the basis for all the COVID certificate requirements – those orders have to have a limit.
General orders need to have some juridical restrictions by their nature.
They cannot be universal like a law would be.
And if these limits do not refer a group of people or something, for example, then they have to refer to a time limit," said Pilving, the Chairman of the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court, on Thursday’s press conference.
"I cannot currently say whether this has already been met today or will be met tomorrow or the next day – this is why these debates are already in court so the truth will be out soon.
But there is a limit to the government’s use of this instrument, which somewhat validates the complaints of criticisers that not even the legislator can distance themselves from these topics," continued Pilving.
General orders are a special type of administrative act, by which the restrictions imposed can be challenged in court only by an individual, with the corresponding court judgment not extending to all the objects of the restriction, but only to the person who has challenged it.
The wide usage of general orders has been criticised by Chancellor of Justice Allar Jõks.
At the same time, the Supreme Court emphasised that the dispute on which the Supreme Court made its decision public on Thursday is still different.
"It concerns one – a special, but still just one institution, the Defence Forces - and there is a slightly looser rule of law here, it does not apply to everyone.
This applies to the Estonian men and women working in the Defence Forces, to whom the head of the respective institution may, to this day, establish obligations based on the Occupational Health and Safety Act," said Pilving.
He elaborated that the practices of the Supreme Court so far suggest that the more extensive, deeper and intensive a restriction or obligation is, the more work the parliament has to do.
"Up to some of these obligations having to be ultimately regulated by law," the Supreme Court judge noted.
"But on the other hand, the issue of vaccination and the pandemic, which comes in waves and requires quick responses, speaks in favour of the decisions of the executive power and the government.
And even if we look at institutions and the demands for the people working in them, then according to the Supreme Court today, in certain circumstances there is room for decrees from the heads of these institutions," he added.
French fishermen are blocking the English Channel for fishing rights
French fishermen are blocking ferry traffic in three ports in the English Channel and in a tunnel between France and Britain on Friday to demand post-Brexit fishing rights, the union said.
Gerard Romiti, chairman of The National Committee for Maritime Fisheries and Marine Livestock (CNPMEM), described the protest as a warning and said that traffic would be blocked in Saint-Malo, Ouistreham and Calais ports and in the Eurotunnel for several hours.
The ongoing dispute between Britain and France over fishing permits remains unresolved and threatens to escalate into a trade war.
"We do not want any donations; we just want our permits back," said Romiti.
"The United Kingdom must abide by the post-Brexit agreement.
We have held our tongues for 11 months.
Even professionals have limits.
We hope that this warning is heard." He did not deny further action.
France has threatened to ban British fishing vessels from bringing their catches to French ports and to impose stricter controls on all British imports.
According to President Emmanuel Macron, such measures should encourage negotiations, but French officials stress that all options are still on the table.
The talks between Clement Beaune, the French minister for European affairs, and David Frost, the British minister for Brexit, have not yet been successful.
According to last year's agreement between Britain and the European Union, European fishing vessels can continue fishing in British waters if they can prove that they have done so before.
Representatives from Paris say that the applications of several French vessels have been unjustifiably rejected.
Representatives from London deny this.
Basketball team lost to Germany with four points in the first half
The Estonian men's basketball team are starting their 2023 World Cup qualifiers abroad against Germany.
The ERR sports portal's blog will be updating live throughout the game starting at 20:00.
Vene dribbles for a long time, searching for the right place and finally gets a foul out of Benzing.
This is the fourth one for the experienced German, but four minutes before the end of the game, both teams have reached their foul limits.
Heckmann fails both free throws.
4:20 left, Germany leads 61-58, but Jurkatamm makes a mistake when passing to Heckmann.
Veideman interferes and Estonia finally earns two more points from the situation.
Veideman does not land the long throw, but Sengfelder cannot make it in from under the basket either and then gets a foul for Nurger.
Jurkatamm helps with defense and the ball stays with the Estonian team.
Doreth does not make the throw, but Treier gets his fourth foul.
One in two, 5:50 before the end of the game Germany leads 61-56.
Vambola Paavo | Let's set a maximum price for petrol following Hungary's example
A month ago I happened to listen to a radio show called “Stuudios on peaminister” (Prime Minister in the Studio).
When the reporter asked Kaja Kallas how much a litre of fuel costs at gas stations, silence followed.
The Prime Minister hesitantly said that she did not know.
At a time when energy is becoming more and more expensive, the head of government does not know how much something costs!
Therefore, her advisors are ignorant and bad at their jobs.
In contrast, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, is very much aware of these things.
Hungary set limits for its fuel prices nation-wide for three months.
They may not exceed 500 forints, or 1.42 euros, per liter at petrol stations.
Currently, the fixed price for three months is set at 480 forints, or 1.37 euros, per liter.
Prices will be checked every three months.
This limit was prompted by accelerating inflation, which is the highest it has been in nine years - 6.5 percent.
According to this decision, chains can charge less for petrol, but not more than the limit.
CHINESE MEDICINE RECOMMENDATIONS: Every home should have this herb!
In late autumn, when it is cold and damp outside, it's important to strengthen and warm up the body.
Many herbs that keep you warm without causing excess heat to build up are suitable for this.
The Tervise Alkeemia blog recommends a convenient method of putting herbs and hot water in a thermos, taking it to work or school and drinking it during the day to support your body.
When the tea runs out, hot water can be poured onto the herbs again.
DISTANCE LEARNING IN TALLINN WAS USELESS!
Using rapid testing in schools had the same effect.
Figures confirm that the four-week distance learning period for grades 4-8 in Tallinn did not give the city an advantage in repelling the virus, because the rapid tests achieved the same result in areas with in-person learning.
Distance learning was also used for a short period in Pärnu and partially in Narva, but in Tallinn it started immediately after the school holidays and lasted for four weeks.
Researchers analysing the virus now have an excellent comparison case with Tallinn versus the rest of Estonia.
After the next state exams, for example, they can look at whether these four weeks of absence yield worse results compared to the rest of the country.
However, the most important question now is whether Tallinn's decision to have its schools use long-distance learning resulted in the city having greater success in its fight against COVID-19.
After all, there was friction between Toompea and the Lower Town due to the activities of Mayor Mikhail Kõlvart.
ANU SÕRITS UNFILTERED ABOUT LIFE: Objectivity, courage to keep your head held high and not underestimating yourself or others is important
Anu has learned from her childhood home that whatever happens, you have to stay strong.
“I come from a large family.
My mother raised five children practically by herself, so we could not demand anything from her.
I had to grow up fast so I could realise my own interests.”
Curiosity has always been the driving force behind Anu Säärits (49), who has been familiar with sports news and broadcasts since childhood.
“I realised pretty early that there was something interesting happening in Tallinn!
I decided to hitch-hike from Tartu and investigate it, and told my family about it only after I came back,” she fondly recalls her determination which repeatedly drove her further for exploration.
Mart Seim: I am the only powerlifter in the Rio Olympics who has not been caught with illegal substances
Estonia's most successful powerlifter, Mart Seim, and his colleague Leho Pent are preparing for the World Cup starting in two weeks.
They both want to at least make it to the 2024 Paris Olympics, if their sport continues to be on the programme.
They could not participate in this summer's Tokyo Olympics, as both men had COVID-19 in the spring that put them in less than ideal conditions for the games.
Reader's letter | A cry for help: you could only see legs kicking the shopping cart
A man rescued a child stuck under a pile of groceries in a shopping cart.
Should children even be in shopping carts?!
“I was on my weekly grocery run, moving to the refrigerated section, when I saw a pair of kicking legs.
At first, I did not understand what was happening, but then it hit me, there was a child stuck in the cart.
I couldn't be sure, but it seemed like the kid was trying to crawl out with their legs in front.
Or maybe the kid had slipped between the groceries and fallen over whilst trying to get back up,” recounts Siim on the situation in the shop.
Slip some local nuts into Santa's giftbag
Sweets, candies and chocolate bars – sounds like the usual choice for Santa's giftbag or Christmas stockings.
In reality, these choices are unhealthy.
Instead, make your child or loved one happy with something healthy.
Various nuts, almonds and seeds are good for you.
Many would probably make a face and point out that nuts are high in fats – would that not make them as unhealthy as sweets?
No, definitely not.
When looking at the nutritional label of a bag of nuts, you can see that that fat is almost entirely made up of healthy and necessary unsaturated fats, with only a small amount of saturated fats and no trans fats whatsoever.
Fats are important for our health and should never be completely cut out.
It is important to look for unsaturated fats, or healthy fats, that are present in nuts, seeds and almonds.
Hence, the only Estonian nut company, Germund Hulgi, recommends choosing healthy snacks during Christmas.
Especially popular are the Germund Hulgi black premium packs, which have the largest nuts and dried fruits.
The hazelnuts originate from Georgia, almonds originate from California, raisins and cranberries come from Chile and cashews are from Vietnam.
Still, the roasting, salting, mixing and packaging happens in Estonia.

The new Kohtla-Järve gym will get super expensive clothes hangers with government funding.
In the newly opened Kohtla-Järve Wiru sports center's expenses list the cost of clothes hangers in the gym's drssing room stands out.
The head of the sports center justifies the price by claiming that they want to be as modern as possible.
“You cannot say that I am not a woman.”
An extraordinary sprinter who ran 100 meters within 9.86 seconds
With naturally high testosterone levels, Namibia's sprinters, Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi, do not fit within the norm and raise questions.
During the Tokyo Olympics, Estonians could cheer for Maicel Uibo's wife, Shaunae Miller-Uibo, when she defended her 400-meter run title.
The victory was staggering, but in all honesty, the potential challengers all dropped out for one reason or another, so the lean Bahamian had to win.
Figuratively speaking, the way to the gold medal was paved for her.
In the Doha World Cup two years earlier, Salwa Eid Naser, a Bahraini quarterback who surprisingly took first place from Miller-Uibo, was punished for failing to take doping tests.
American born and raised Athing Mu, a 19-year-old new super talent, chose the 800-m run in which she became the Olympic winner.
And the Namibian sprinters (Christine Mboma with the time of 48.54 and Beatrice Masiling with the time of 49.53) were banned by the World Athletics Association (WA) from participating in the 400-meter run due to high testosterone levels.
But what will happen to them?
Mboma ja Masilingi, having placed second and sixth respectively in the 200-meter run in Tokyo, are still a topic of discussion.
No one seems to be content.
Some think they were discriminated against and some believe that the duo should not be allowed to participate in the womens' division.
The issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible, with the observers saying that it is only a matter of time before Mboma's going to set world records with her bad start but unprecedented speed.
The government made an exception: more spectators will be allowed for the Estonian-Israeli qualifiers
This Sunday, the government considered the Estonian-Israel men's basketball World Cup qualifiers to be events of overriding public interest and will allow up to 3360 spectators for the games.
According to current restrictions, from 15 November up to 1000 spectators will be allowed to take part in indoor sports competitions.
The government announced on its website that the Health Board will support events with more participants if the organiser follows the given plan to help mitigate the risk of spreading the virus.
The spectators in Saku Suurhall will be divided into four zones and will not come into contact with each other, the players or the staff.
People still need to have a COVID certificate to enter the event and masks will be checked on-site.
The zones will take into account the dispersal of people and each area has separate ventilation.
The use of trumpets and the like is prohibited.
The Estonian Basketball Association will give advance notice for spectators to arrive at the game in time and avoid queues at the entrance with checking certifications and documents.
The doors will open an hour before the start of the event.
A total of 14 different entrances are open for the four zones.
The Estonian national team will start the 2023 World Cup qualifiers on Thursday evening, facing Germany in Nuremberg.
Tickets for Sunday's game with Israel can be purchased from Piletitasku.
The food had been ordered and the invitations sent, but the Finns decided to cancel the presidential ball at the last minute
The Office of the President of Finland announced today that the presidential ball would not be held on Independence Day for the second year in a row.
The decision was delayed until the last moment with the event being set for 6 December.
That means that a lot of work had already been put into organising the ball.
Invitations were sent out some time ago and drinks and meals were also ordered.
According to the office, nothing will be going to waste because it can all be used for future events.
The invitations sent out this time will also be valid next year, writes Iltalehti.
"Preparations took into account a small number of guests, so less things were gathered," said a spokesman for the office.
The reason for cancelling the ball is the same as last year.
Namely, there is concern about the increase in COVID infections.
The presidential couple Sauli Niinistö and Jenni Haukio have still found a way to celebrate Independence Day with the nation.
On 6 December the president and the head lady will give an interview live from the palace for Yle.
Several well-known musicians will also perform on the broadcast.
Good example: On holidays, Anett Kontaveit does not just sit idly but helps those in need
After an exhausting tournament in Mexico, the Estonian tennis star took some time off to rest in her homeland.
But she spends this time helping those in need.
Anett Kontaveit does not sit around idly but is practical about her use of time.
She posts about the plants she grows at home on Instagram, calling herself a "plant mom".
She also does volunteer work, raising awareness on the activities of Animal Shelters NGO.
Anett posted a picture of dogs on her social media, saying that she will be helping them this year as well.
On Monday's press conference, Anette Kontaveit said that her goal is to win the Grand Slam.
"I have thought about it for a few days," she told Delfi Sport.
"Of course I want to win the Grand Slam, but it is more important to set goals based on my own development.
I want to improve my games, specific tennis elements and my physical condition.
If I manage to develop well, better results will follow."
Kontaveit thanked her fans, who were awake at night during her games in Mexico. ”It was very heartwarming to see how many people were cheering for me.
I have gotten so much positive feedback and I am thankful to everyone that cares for what I do.
I would also like to thank my supporters and sponsors, who have made this all possible.”
After a short rest, Kontaveit will start her preparations for the new season in Tallinn and, as the Australian tournaments approach, she will fly to a warmer place to acclimatise.

Singer Jessie J lost her child: I have no control of my emotions
The popular musician recently broke up with her partner Max Pham, but still decided to go through with her pregnancy and raise their child alone.
Sadly, the doctors could not detect the child's heartbeat in a recent scan, said Jessie J in her Instagram post.
“Yesterday morning I was laughing with a friend, saying: “Seriously though, how am I going to get through my gig in LA tomorrow night without telling the whole audience I am pregnant?”,” the singer wrote.
“By yesterday afternoon I was dreading the thought of getting through the gig without breaking down.
After going for my 3rd scan and being told there was no longer a heartbeat.
This morning.
I feel like I have no control of my emotions.
I might regret posting this. I might not.
I actually don't know.”
Despite the fact that she is grieving, she has decided to go through with her Los Angeles gig, believing that it might help her.
“I want to sing tonight.
Not because I am avoiding the grief or the process, but because I know singing tonight will help,” she wrote.
“I have done 2 shows in 2 years and my soul needs this.
Even more today.
I know some people will be thinking she should just cancel it but in this moment I have clarity on one thing.
I started singing when I was young for joy, to fill my soul and self love therapy.
That hasn't changed and I have to process this my way.”
Jessie J said that she had decided to raise the child alone because she had long waited to be a mum.
She knows that life is short and that getting pregnant was a miracle and an experience that she will never forget.
She hopes to get pregnant again in the future, but currently she is in shock and grieving.
“But I know I am strong, and I know I will be ok,” she added.
“I also know millions of women all over the world have felt this pain and even worse.”

Rapeseed wax is a renewable and an environmentally friendly raw material.
It is time for the yearly autumnal candle making season.
Candles can, of course, be made in the spring and summer as well, but autumn fits this task best.
Outside it is dark and rainy, the wind is blowing.
Meanwhile you have candle is melting in a pot, filling the house with wonderful scents.
These are magical times.
Our ancestors made candles from precious sheep fat, using them only on special occasions.

Choosing between them all might be overwhelming.
A new peculiar TikTok beauty trend: women are using lubricant as foundation
TikTok users are once again introducing a new beauty trend, recommending people to switch out their foundations for lube used in the bedroom.
About the tragic fate of Johannes Vares: suicide or murder?
Did Johannes Vares shoot himself to get ahead of death?
Or was he forced or intimidated into killing himself?
Or was he killed because he protested mentally not physically...
Peeter Olesk ponders in his latest work on the life and death of Vares-Barbarus.
In the early morning, when Johannes Vares, pseudonym Johannes Barbarus, (12 January 1890-29 November 1946) was found dead on the floor of his bathroom in his Kadriorg apartment, he had not been shaving his beard with a pocketknife but a real shaving blade, a lotion and a foam brush.
It should not have been hard or painful for he most likely shaved every day, but he of course had many different solutions near his mirror for treating bloody cuts.
The question is whether he wrote his suicide letters before getting infront of the mirror or after, when he had already shaved.
The answer to this would help us clarify what time Johannes Vares woke up that day, how much time he had to write his notes and where he wrote them.
A writing desk, white paper, ink and a quill are not commonplace in bathrooms!
Writing two long and personal letters takes about an hour.
Shaving, brushing teeth and gargling could have taken him a few minutes, but what Johannes Vares could not have known was the time it would have taken people to start searching for him and who would have found him first.
Taking this into consideration, I think the suicide notes were written long before his death, at least the night before.
This means that they were written with clear intent.
According to the verbal notice from Nigol Andresen, Johannes Vares did not want to live the rest of his life disabled.
From this we can deduce that he knew about the state of his illness.
The word “disabled” does not only stand for something externally noticeable, it can also mean not being able to work or taking a sick leave from work.
A murder victim hidden under a stack of books in Nõmme.
This is now a cold case
In 2019, the police got a peculiar call to come to Lemmik Street in Nõmme: while renovating an old house, a skeleton was found in a room hidden under a neat stack of books.
How is this possible?
An elderly lady has been visited by the detectives twice, but the perfect moment for asking questions has not come up yet.
This woman might hold answers to a murder: according to one source, years ago, she said her son might be responsible for it.
Gas over brakes.
A controversial factory got its cornerstone despite the ongoing court debate
This summer, members of the government said that without an official court ruling the plant cannot be built.
Despite this, last week on Thursday the oil plant got its cornerstone with the approval of ministers.
On 16 November, Eesti Energia laid the cornerstone for the oil plant Enefit280, for the construction of which the government allocated 125 million euros of taxpayers' money to the state-owned company. The construction was sued by young climate activists.
The more observant will remember that just half a year ago, the Tartu District Court suspended the construction permit of the plant under preliminary legal protection and Prime Minister Kaja Kallas sent a clear message to Eesti Energia: they have to pull the brakes on construction of the plant until the debate is cleared.
But in November, Eesti Energia stepped on the gas instead and began construction.
Legally, Eesti Energia has the right to start building the plant, because at the beginning of June, the construction ban on the oil plant was overturned by the Tartu District Court.
The company still took a risk by laying the cornerstone for the plant, as the dispute over the legality of the building permit is still pending.
"If the buildings and facilities of the factory are built before the litigation ends, but the complaint is satisfied and the building permit is revoked, then the further course of events depends on the court's reasoning.
There is a possibility that the buildings turn out to be illegal, and in theory, they might have to be demolished," explained Kärt Vaarmari, a lawyer at the Environmental Law Center.
The only Australian in Lääne County teaches Estonians to eat grass
Matthew Hill, having moved from Australia to Estonia with his wife Piret has now started an organic sod farm in Lääne County, Jaagu farm.
Year-round, the family grows various sod strains and even won the title of best organic farm.
Read more from the new issue of Maaleht.
Matthew Hill, having moved from Australia to Estonia, started an organic sod farm in Lääne County with his wife Piret.
On his vegetable beds, the owner prefers to cultivate without a shovel, i.e. he practices sustainable agriculture, which is already popular in the rest of the world: the beds are not dug, only lightly aerated.
The Hill family's fresh ideas and practices in agriculture have garnered a lot of attention and won them this year's best organic farm title.
German scientists are teaching cattle to use the toilet.
The results could change the world
A small herd of cattle in Germany has learned an impressive habit.
They are using a small area covered in fake grass with a fence around it as a toilet.
But why is this sort of training necessary?
About 10% of human greenhouse gas emissions in the world is caused by cattle.
German scientists are trying to make raising cattle more environmentally friendly with a solution that sounds impossible.
The prosecutor on the case of a man beating a woman to death: he had regrets and voluntarily seeked help
On Wednesday we wrote about a case where Kiur, who had been abusing a woman and whose carelessness caused her death was asked to be punished with two years in prison with a probation of three years and three months.
This means that as of now, he has only had to spend two days behind bars.
The district prosecutor Kelly Kruusimägi says the punishment is reasonable as Kiur regretted what he had done and voluntarily seeked help for his problems.
The prosecutor's comment was as follows:
"The evidence collected in the investigation before the trial indicate that Kiur hit the woman in the face once and she died almost two days later.
The evidence proves that she kept in contact with Kiur immediately after being hit and the following two days.
The woman left the apartment the next day, moved about and according to Kiur he was not aware that the woman's life was in danger and that she needed medical help.
He can be believed because when looking at the event as a whole, the woman might have had some problems with coordination as an alcoholic.
The victim was also not bleeding after the punch and did not complain about anything unusual.
So we concluded he had no intention to kill and the evidence did not indicate that he had the indication to maim.
Kiur has no current punishments.
He confessed to punching the victim and expressed his regrets for doing that and for not seeing the need to call an ambulance.
He voluntarily seeked help for his alcoholism and has a job.
Taking everything into consideration, most importantly the specific action and his previous behaviour, the prosecutor's office asked for two years in prison which will not be enforced if Kiur does not commit a new crime during his probation of three years and three months.
Probation is a period of time during which the person has prove that he will continue to live by the law, which is one of the aims of this punishment.
All the parties agreed to the solution, including the vicitm's mother who also said she did not believe Kiur wanted the woman dead."
A day in traffic: there were three vehicles involved in an accident in Tallinn city centre
Yesterday morning there was an accident in Tallinn city centre involving three cars, one of which was parked along the street.
There was a traffic accident at 9:53 in Tallinn at the intersection of Pronksi Street and Gonsiori Street, preliminary reports stating that a 38-year-old man was driving an Audi R8 that collided with an Audi Q7 being driven by a 44-year-old woman.
The Audi R8 hit a parked Ford Turneo as a result of the collision.
The Audi Q7's driver was taken to East Tallinn Central Hospital.
The exact details of the collision are being clarified.
At 15:20 in Võru, a 48-year-old woman driving a Mercedes-Benz hit a 75-year-old woman crossing the road near 46 Jüri street.
The driver took the pedestrian to get checked at Võru Hospital.
One driver under the influence of drugs and one driver under the influence of alcohol were caught in the last 24 hours.
A grey 2004 Volvo V40 with the number plate 789BSN was stolen from the area under the South Prefecture's jurisdiction.
Ülo Kalm: a great hospital was promised during the election.
The money will come from Brussels, but where will the employees and equipment come from?
How will the mayor, whose father is Ülo and mother Liidia, succeed in managing a multinational city?
What's both sad and funny is the former mayor Savisaar's belief that trust is eternal, which resulted in him submitting himself as an ambassador candidate once again.
The star had gone out.
Election results in Narva are proof that trust is already more important than language and nationality.
Doctors have to fight for trust against witch doctors who offer opinions instead of facts.
In addition, gentlemen who have absolutely no trust in our hospital system have appeared in the spotlight (specifically in the newspaper).
I just read a city gentleman's confession about what he went through in the North Estonia Medical Centre.
Alo Raun: congratulations, 55% support the civil partnership law!
55% - according to a questionnaire, the civil partnership law has gained majority support among Estonians who are 18 years old or older who have been asked to give their opinion.
These are the people who can vote for Parliament members and participate in referendums.
This was concluded from Norstat's September and October questionnaire results that were ordered by SA Liberaalne Kodanik.
This trend has been around for a while according to the same questionnaire.
So when talking about what "the people want" it is no longer accurate to say that we/they are against the civil partnership law.
A new and "truly horrific" coronavirus variation B.1.1.528 has been found in Botswana.
A new coronavirus variation B.1.1.529 with 32 proteins has been identified in Botswana and it is not yet known whether the antibodies people already have are capable of properly reacting to it.
Only a handful of this variation's infections have been found as a result of sequencing - three in Botswana, six in South Africa and one in Hong Kong.
Therefore, scientists hope that COVID cases caused by this new variation are not common, according to Sky News.
London Imperial College's virologist Tom Peacock called the abundance of mutations discovered on the variation "truly horrific":
Viruses use proteins to enter human cells and most vaccines' aim is to teach the human organism to recognise and neutralise them.
Therefore the protein mutations may be problematic with mRNA vaccines.
London University's professor Francois Balloux said that the new variation should be carefully watched and its spread analysed.
"But there is no reason for excessive concern, except if it continues to spread in the near future," he continued.
The professor added that B.1.1.529's abundance of mutations may be caused by it "developing during an immunodeficient person's chronic illness, maybe an untreated HIV/AIDS patient."
The first COVID cases of this variation were identified in Botswana 11 November and in South Africa three days later.
A 36-year-old man was identified in Hong Kong who had a negative PCR-test before flying from Hong Kong to South Africa where he spent 22 October to 11 November.
His test result when returning was negative but on 13 November, his test result was positive.
According to the Guardian, some South African virologists are already concerned, especially when considering the recent increase in cases in Gauteng, where B.1.1.529 have been identified.
Cambridge University professor of clinical microbiology Ravi Gupta told the newspaper that his lab found that the B.1.1.529's two mutations increased the contagion of the virus and decreased the antibodies' recognisation of the virus.
European Commission: vaccine passes should last 9 months when travelling and have no expiration date after a booster shot
The European Commission just proposed setting time frames for vaccine passes for people travelling among the European Union countries.
The proposal states that a vaccine pass that lasts for at least 9 months should be given out after the first vaccination cycle.
This means that the countries cannot refuse a vaccine pass that confirms it has been less than 9 months since the last vaccine when checking passengers.
The commission's proposal states that vaccine passes given out after a booster shot do not have the 9 month expiration period.
This means that, at least at first, the passes given out after booster shots should have no expiration date.
The commission noted that, "It's possible that the protection after the booster shot will last longer than after the first vaccination which is why the commission is keeping a careful eye on new scientific data on this subject.
Based on that, the commission may later propose to also set a time limit on vaccine passes given out after booster shots."
In order to give enough time to implement the new procedure, the commission proposes to start making adjustments starting with 10 January 2022.
The commission's Commissioner of Justice Didier Reynders noted at today's press conference that the only acceptable vaccines are the ones approved by the European Medicines Agency and not, for example, passes From Hungary where people have been given the Russian Sputnik or Chinese SinoVac.
At this time, there have been over 650 million vaccine passes given out in the European Union.
The commission also found that the testing, quarantine or extra restrictions should not be mandated for people who have a COVID pass valid in the European Union, no matter where in the European Union they are coming from.
People with no valid EU COVID pass should be allowed to travel based on a test administered before or after arrival.
The EU's traffic light map will be renewed as follows: new cases will be checked together with the level of vaccination in the area.
Travellers arriving from the green areas should have no mandated restrictions.
On the other hand, people should be advised against travelling to and from countries in the dark red areas because of the amount of cases in the areas, and travellers who have not been vaccinated or had COVID should be tested and forced to quarantine.
Exceptions should be adjusted for border crossing commuters, children under the age of 12 and essential travel.
The commision states that the list of people allowed essential travel should be limited because many people currently on the list have had the chance to get vaccinated in the meantime.
Chinese company: the Parliament has passed a discriminatory law that hurts competition
The Chinese technology company Huawei does not hide the fact it does not like the electronic communications law that was passed in the Parliament yesterday - apparently, it gives the executives the opportunity to discriminate entrepreneurs based purely on what country their head office is located in.
Ben Chang Bin, director of Huawei Tehcnologies Eesti, said, "The law makes it safe to assume that getting a licence to use hardware and software from a producer in a country outside of the European Union, NATO or OECD may be significantly more difficult than from a producer whose head office is located in a country that belongs to one of those."
According to Huawei's statement, connecting the producer of the hardware and software used in communications to a specific country is not reasonable because all major companies are international and have similar supply chains.
The company's assessment states that the technology's safety can also be guaranteed by "transparent and proportional methods and avoiding baseless discrimation of participants and hurting competition".
The new version of the electronical communications, building code and state fees law states that the government has the right to make it mandatory for the communication companies to apply for approval to use hardware and software.
The approval must go through the authorities.
The list of cases where software and hardware is banned is so long that there are probably no countries or producers in the whole world to meet the requirements in Estonia.
For example, it is enough for a company to have supply problems, cyber attacks from its mother country or another product of theirs having security issues.
The producer or its head office is in a country that does not belong in the European Union, NATO or OECD.
The producing country does not follow the principles of a democratic country or violates human rights.
The producing country does not protect another country's people's intellectual property, personal data or business secrets.
The producing country has an aggressive cyber behaviour.
There have been cyber attacks on countries belonging to the EU, NATO or OECD in the producing country.
The producer obeys the government or other state institution of the country of their location or another foreign country with no judicial inspection.
The country where the producer is located or another foreign country might force it to endanger Estonian security.
The producer's economic activity is not based on market competition or there are no sufficient conditions for it in the country it is located in.
The producer's ownership structure, organisational structure or leadership structure is not transparent.
The producer's funding is not transparent.
The producer's products or services have security vulnerabilities and there have been no sufficient security measures taken to eliminate them.
The producer is not capable of consistently supplying products or services, except in the case of force majeure.
After the Parliament's decision, Estonia can finally have an auction of 5G frequencies of telecommunication companies.
Estonia is the last European Union country to start using 5G.
Mihkel Raud on COVID posting on social media: it's like 15 minutes of fame that make it easy to beg for sympathy
As a wise man once said, "Life is what happens when you're making other plans."
I think that man was John Lennon.
But we have a tendency to attribute brilliant quotes to the people we like the most so it is possible these wise words were said by somebdoy else.
But this has close to no effect on the quote's point.
I had nice plans.
I was supposed to perform with Singer Vinger in Sindi then take a bus to Tallinn where I would participate in "Eesti otsib superstaari" the following day - exactly how I had performed, rode and participated numerous times in a dozen years.
But life had other plans.
I tried to convince the other members of Singer Vinger not to take another stop saying "I don't feel so good, can we just go straight to the city?"
We had already made three stops.
The bus took a turn into the woods, they had another smoke break and I felt my fever rising with every second.
And if you're now thinking that you've stumbled onto another COVID-story, you're only half right.
General physician warns: the flu is on the move!
It is a severe illness, not just a cough and a runny nose.
How can you protect yourself?
People talk a lot about the coronavirus, how to prevent it and how it is treated.
According to Triinu-Mari Ots, director and physican at Laagri Perearstikeskus, this might cause people to forget that there are many respiratory viruses moving about during autumn and winter and that the flu has already made its way to Estonia, so this is the last chance to protect yourself.
The typical Estonian cough, runny nose and sore throat season of autumn and winter has begun, during which there are many viruses moving about that can cause extreme respiratory infections.
According to Triinu-Mari, "The most common ones are rhinovirus, RS-virus, adenovirus and the paraflu.
These altogether are called extreme respiratory virus infections and a specific symptom is treated, be it a cough, sore throat, a runny nose or a headache."
The flu is an exception, as it has a very specific course which is possible to identify during the first days of infection.
"In this case, tests are also taken to have a laboratory confirmation of the presence of flu," said the doctor.
This is important in order to choose the right treatment and to prevent or limit outbreaks at work, in a gym or at school.
"HALF MOON": Reading recommendations for the autumn COVID crisis
Does the increase in time spent at home promote increased reading habits?
Hard to say, though quantity is of little importance at the end of the day.
What can you find in our bookstores?
Naturally, biographies and cookbooks top the charts but luckily there's much more to be found.
Journalist Andres Raid and legal researcher and cleric Igor Gräzin discuss books that surround us and are easily accessible.
A step backwards for the green transition or just downright stupid: roadside restrooms and rubbish bins are to be removed
The Estonian Transport Administration shows us another example of the dark side of austerity as they go against the heavily promoted principles of eco consciousness.
Since the Transport Administration is required to cut operating costs by 3.5 million euros next year, one of the proposed measures is to remove restrooms and rubbish bins from car parks.
In an interview with Estonian Public Broadcasting, director of the Infrastructure Administration Division Raido Randmaa explained the decision as having the least impact on road safety.
The Transport Administration manages restrooms in 61 car parks and rubbish bins in 63 car parks all over Estonia.
The annual operating costs of restrooms amount to 472,000 euros and 267,000 euros for rubbish bins.
According to Randmaa, the decision has already been agreed upon at the Transport Administration, but it's still not official as the Transport Administration's budget has yet to be approved.
"God help us – as the former director of Circle K and current director of Ragn-Sells, I cannot keep quiet about this," CEO Kai Realo wrote on social media.
"The biggest challenge Circle K faced in building new roadside stations that naturally included rubbish bins and restrooms was acquiring sites where the Transport Administration would allow decent entry and exit ramps since, in their words, 'Estonia is so small that people can drive from one end to the other without stopping for fuel, food or restrooms'."
Realo noted that the attitudes back then were enough to leave her speechless, but the decision now is downright sensless. "Can you even imagine this promised land of peeing men and forestside garbage piles?"
South-American prostitutes and illegal immigrants take advantage of Estonia's "open borders"
Estonia's "open borders" have also made it an attraction for disreputable characters.
BNS writes: On Wednesday, the police deported a Brazilian woman who had been engaged in prostitution in the capital.
According to the North Prefecture of the Police and Border Guard Board, a 29-year-old Brazilian woman's visa-free stay in Estonia was terminated prematurely on Wednesday, 24 November, because she engaged in paid prostitution in Tallinn.
The woman was granted an injunction order requiring her to leave Estonia and a refusal of entry to the Schengen territory for one year.
This is not the first time this has happened.
The police also deported a Columbian woman working as a prostitute in July this year.
The North Prefecture conducted an illegal immigration procedure for the Columbian woman born in 1988 who arrived in Estonia with the intention of selling intimate services.
The woman was granted an injunction order requiring her to leave the country and a refusal of entry for 3 years.
In December of 2019, the news site Uued Uudised reported, "The police deported a Brazilian man who had been engaging in prostitution in Tallinn.
The North Prefecture reported that a Brazilian citizen born in 1998 was subjected to an illegal immigration procedure on Thursday by a member of staff of the North Prefecture Border Guard.
The police noted that the man was uncooperative and had been selling intimate services in Tallinn.
His stated travel intentions did not match his actual intentions.
The police terminated the man's visa-free stay prematurely and granted him an injunction order requiring him to leave Estonia as well as a refusal of entry for 3 years."
South-Americans have found their way into Estonia through other paths as well.
Delfi Ärileht reported this August that "A Toyota Yaris with an Estonian license plate was stopped by police on the evening of 4 August. The driver was a Brazilian woman born in 1993.
The woman turned out to be a food courier without a work permit who was then deported from Estonia.
She had a delivery service bag in the car and her phone showed that an order had been completed less than 10 minutes earlier.
The person's short-term employment was not registered with the Police and Border Guard Board.
The woman's visa was revoked and her visa-free stay in Estonia was shortened.
The woman was granted an injunction requiring her to leave Estonia within 15 days as well as a refusal of entry for 3 months."
The story of the 27 immigrants who perished in the English Channel was promptly picked up by the propaganda machine
While the death of 27 immigrants in the English Channel was undoubtedly tragic, it was promptly picked up by the propaganda machine of the liberal West to justify its own inaction.
The most hypocritical response to the incident was offered by France, whose President Emmanuel Macron cautioned the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson against using the immigration crisis to further their own political agendas while explicitly referring to the boat accident claiming 27 lives in the English Channel.
This was after French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnshon had agreed on Wednesday over the phone to intensify counteraction to prevent lethal crossings of the Channel.
"Both of the leaders were clear about the tragic loss of life highlighting the importance of moving forward with all measures to prevent lethal crossings and break the criminal business model behind it," said a spokesperson for the British government.
The United Kingdom is the destination, while France is a transit country through which immigrants move freely. It's where they live in camps and wait for human traffickers. Paris should be responsible for preventing immigrants from using France as a transit point, as well as blocking the English Channel from human trafficking.
The Brits don't want them and neither do the French - so what prevents the closure of the migration route?
The French Minister of the Interior Gerald Darmanin announced on Thursday that five people had been arrested in connection with the immigrant boating accident on Wednesday that claimed 27 lives in the English Channel.
Lille's prosecutor confirmed the deaths of 17 men, seven women and three minors who had been on board the sunken boat near the north coast of France.
Darmanin specified that four people were already arrested on suspicion of human trafficking on Wednesday afternoon.
While the French did not hold back in expressing their so-called regret, human traffickers would not be able to operate without the state's support – support which stems from inability to close the English Channel migration route (which would definitely be possible) as well as nurturing human trafficking through policies allowing mass migration through the country.
On Wednesday evening, President Emmanuel Macron stated that France would not allow the English Channel to become a cemetery and vowed that the authorities would find those responsible for this tragedy.
Prosecutors in France have opened a murder investigation.
The President does not hold himself accountable though it has been during his term that France has been allowed to be flooded with migrants.
French Minister of the Interior Gerald Darmian has called for a 'strong international response'.
According to him, four people have been arrested in direct connection with the case.
"We must not judge the criminal nature of the people responsible for organising these crossings lightly," he added.
"The catastrophe on the Channel is tragic," Prime Minister Jean Castex tweeted.
"My thoughts are with the perished and affected who fell victim to the smugglers taking advantage of their misery."
The hypocrisies of the French authorities will not suffice to prevent human trafficking and drownings.
German luxury car brands lead the way with the highest number of cars with reversed mileage
Odometer rollbacks are among the most popular used car market schemes.
This method is used to raise the price of a used car while lowering its value.
A recent carVerticali study showed that buyers purchasing a German luxury brand car are at a higher risk of buying a car with a rolled back odometer.
TOP 10 cars with the highest odds of a rolled back odometer: the BMW M5 tops the list
The IT company carVertical analysed the history of more than 700,000 used cars from reports created between November 2020 and November 2021 in their search to compile a list of cars with the highest likelihood of reversed mileage.
The study included 18 different markets including Poland, Romania, Hungary, France, Slovenia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Serbia, Germany, Croatia, Russia, United States of America and Italy.
Mileage records show that the BMW M5 is the car with the most frequently tampered odometer. More than one third of the used vehicles were linked to suspected fraud.
This statistic does not represent the true extent of the issue BMW faces in regard to rolled back odometers. CarVertical's car expert Matas Buzelis recently noted that the entire list is dominated by different BMW models:
"Half of the TOP 10 list is taken up by this brand's cars.
The figure reflects the demand for used BMW cars in various markets.
The data also revealed that more expensive cars are linked to higher likelihoods of tampered mileage indicators which is a factor that needs to be taken into consideration when buying a used vehicle.
A mileage inspection is needed at this point."
The second and third place on the list of cars with highest frequency of reversed mileage are occupied respectively by BMW 7 Series with 33.4 percent and Subaru Outback with 31.8 percent.
Audi A8 was the 5th most frequent car to be linked to mileage fraud while its twin A7 landed on 10th place. Over a quarter (25.8 percent) of the former had their mileage artificially reversed.
The more frequent representation of luxury vehicles in lists of cars with tampered odometers results from a higher possible cut received in marking up the cars, as explained by Matas Buzelis.
It is relatively easy and cheap for dishonest car dealers to increase their earnings by rolling back the odometer.
A full list of the 20 most frequent cars with rolled back odometres can be found in the study.
Most frequent cars with rolled back odometers by date of manufacture: older cars are linked to a higher likelihood of fraud
Studies show that it is important to conduct a mileage inspection, especially with older cars.
The most popular cars linked to reversed mileage were manufactured between the years 2006 and 2016.
Car expert Matas Buzelis further emphasises the connection between likelihood of fraud and the price of the car:
"Although regular cars are also represented in small percentages that fall below the total of tampered cars, the list of cars with most frequent cases of reversed mileage is composed mainly of luxury vehicles.
Subaru, Ford and Volkswagen also fall into the same age category as luxury cars.
It seems that cars between the ages of 5 to 15 years have the highest likelihood of having a rolled back odometer."
The Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce: we cannot let production fall victim to the green transition
The Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce recognises entrepreneurs, consumers and the government all need to work together to reach climate neutrality, however achieving the goals of the green transition cannot be attained by reducing local production and livestock numbers.
Entrepreneurs, consumers and the government must work together to ensure that the changes brought on by the green transition are economically feasible for enterprises.
It is of great importance to the Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce that, before any decisions are made, there is a clear understanding of the dual effect that the climate package and European Green Deal would have on Estonian agriculture and food production.
A comprehensive evaluation must be conducted based on location and management approach to get an accurate overview of the true impact of the Estonian agricultural sector on the environment.
The goals of the green transition cannot be achieved through reducing local production and livestock numbers.
The Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce supports the path chosen by the European Commission to achieve climate neutrality by the year 2050, though they admit it will be a great challenge for the Estonian agricultural, food, forestry and rural economy sectors.
BNS reports that a letter sent to the Estonian Ministry of Environment describing the stance the Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce has taken regarding the climate package "Fit for 55" states that with every challenge comes its own set of opportunities that need to be utilised carefully.
The Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce headed by Roomet Sõrmus was leading the initiative to bring Ukrainian workers to Estonia last year, while still trying to appease both the green transition as well as farmers whose wants are notoriously hard to align.
Farmers are also encircled by all kinds of ideological and pressure groups such as animal rights and environmental activists, vegans and others whose activities aim to restrict or end livestock farming.
Migration pressure increases: Finnish entrepreneurs based in Estonia are not satisfied either and the threat of tax hikes looms large
It is ironic that the Estonian Reform Party uses Finns who complain that the country has a labour shortage as their spokespeople while Estonians are traveling to work in Finland instead. Why not bring them back home to work for Finnish companies that are based here?
At the same time, there is constant media coverage of labour shortages, which appears to be a new propaganda campaign to get people used to immigration.
BNS reports that in one of the meetings of the Finnish-Estonian Chamber of Commerce, foreign entrepreneurs based in Estonia highlighted Estonia's biggest shortfall as the labour shortage.
"Both Estonia and Finland face a similar problem which is the ever increasing skilled workforce shortage brought on by an ageing population," said Andres Sutt, Minister of Entrepreneurship and Information Technology, at the meeting.
"We may yet find a similar solution on both sides of the Gulf. The recruitment of foreign workers with similar values to our own may be the answer to the ever increasing shortage of skilled labor while ensuring tax compliance," he said.
Andres Sutt should study Finland's course of action more carefully and take note of how they are solving the crisis with both Finnish and foreign 'skilled workers' and tell us whether the Estonian Reform Party sees this as a viable option.
The Minister also refuses to comment on the fact that Estonian and Finnish companies are facing the same problem because of the emigration of Estonians that took place during the Reform Party's last term in office.
This topic is clearly illustrated by the following statistic: "According to data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, in five years' time there will be 31,000 fewer people of working age and the only alternative for raising the country's revenue base would be to raise taxes."
As a result, we are threatened with higher taxes and no pensions if we don't approve of foreigners.
Yet, they tend to "forget" that bringing in foreign workers causes Estonian wages to fall.
These threats seemed to have disappeared for a while until they resurfaced a few years ago in the form of an article describing the prospective labour shortage in the year 2040 in the fields of construction, agriculture and many others. The writer seems to believe that there will be no technological advancement for the next 20 years, so work will still be done by hand in the aforementioned year.
Paul Oja: Tom Clancy's dark action novels also included futuristic visions of a pandemic
The 1960s brought with them a fresh breath of air among Soviet science fiction novels as they started to slowly break apart from their roots of being overly concerned with technical details or focusing on fighting destruction.
On the one hand, the stories were constructed to revolve around a happy communist future for humanity (Ivan Yefremov's 1957 "Andromeda Nebula", Arkady and Boris Strugatsky 1962 "Noon") while on the other hand they focused on condemning the West's idealism by criticising the dystopic future that emerges from a rotting capitalist regime with its wars, terrorist acts or pandemics.
Most common speculations involved the phrase, "In the year 2000..."
So, which future do we live in and what is yet to come? ... Indeed, Soviet communism met its end and disappeared into the depths of history far before this magical date.
Though sharp Western authors still provide food for thought.
Tom Clancy, a skilled and accomplished author of many technological thrillers or so-called tech action novels, definitely kept a keen eye on world events.
In 1975, a Soviet rocket carrier tried to escape from Riga to Sweden but was stopped only 50 nautical miles before the maritime boundaries of Sweden.
Clancy's thriller "The Hunt for Red October" was published in 1984 and became an international bestseller. This event certainly could have served as inspiration for it.
"Patriot Games" (published in 1987) describes the terrorist acts committed by the Irish Republican Army.
"The Cardinal of the Kremlin" (published in 1988) sheds light on the space race between the USA and Soviet Union with Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative at the forefront while weaving in a side plot concerning the Soviet Union's failed war in Afghanistan.
"Clear and Present Danger" (published in 1989) describes a war against drug lords taking place both in Columbian forests and offices in Washington. "The Sum of All Fears" (published in 1991) dives deep into what would happen if Middle Eastern terrorists would gain possession of a nuclear weapon.
After a while the relation between Tom Clancy's topics and the world's timeline started to change, however.
Paying attention to currents in the world's development made it possible to predict certain key events, which tended to be rather dark and turn from thrilling stories into reality.
The end of the novel "Debt of Honor" describes how a terrorist crashes a plane into the White House during a meeting of Congress while the President is in attendance.
The novel was published in 1994 and we are all too familiar with the events that transpired on 9 September 2001.
The masterful threatening visions of Tom Clancy have not all come true.
The great war between China and Russia described in the 2000 novel "The Bear and the Dragon" is yet to happen.
Another example?
As opposed to the opinion of Francis Fukuyama and the prophet Priscilla's Perestroika-era statement, history has not ended just yet…
The novel "Executive Orders" (published in 1996) depicts events involving a biological attack on the USA with the intention of inducing the fall of the country during the ensuing pandemic.
The pandemic described in the book doesn't last long thanks to the high rate of vaccination.
Creating an effective vaccine is, of course, easier in a book than it is in real life.
The stakes in the novel "Rainbow Six", published in 1998, are much higher.
It depicts the story of a scientist who's at the top of his field as well as a leader of one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies and has gathered a group of like-minded people around him. He have taken it on himself to rid the world of most of its population by inducing a pandemic in order to save the planet from a man-made doom.
He creates a new virus based on Ebola that is guaranteed to be lethal.
At the same time, two vaccines are created.
Vaccine A is created to provide true immunity.
This vaccine is only injected to collaborators and other trustworthy or necessary people before the release of the virus.
Vaccine B, on the other hand, is intended for the general public after the pandemic is induced.
Although the virus will appear to provide some kind of protection, it will only serve to further disperse the virus to reach its original goal.
The virus is planned to first spread through the air conditioning of a stadium during the Olympic Games held in the Australian heat.
In the end, a former KGB agent tips off the Rainbow anti-terrorism fighters and so humanity is saved and life goes on as normal.

A step towards a more sustainable future: SEAT connects factories in Spain and Portugal with a rail line to reduce CO2 emissions
The Spanish car manufacturer SEAT has made it its goal to become carbon neutral by the year 2050.
To achieve this, SEAT has launched an environmental programme “Move to Zerø” to reduce CO2 emissions across its product, service and logistics lifecycles.
In the latest step of its “Move to Zerø” strategy, SEAT is planning a railway connection between the factory in Martorell (Spain) and the Volkswagen Autoeuropa factory in Palmelas (Portugal).
Until now, vehicles manufactured in Martorell have been transported to Salobral (Madrid) by train and then to various dealerships by trucks.
The new railway allows the vehicles to be transported directly to the Palmela factory from where they will be transported by truck for the final time to the Azambuja distribution station 75 kilometres away.
The new service will start operating twice a week with the estimated yearly total of transporting 20,000 vehicles.
This will cut the annual truck deliveries by 2400 and reduce CO2 emissions by a whopping 43%.
The new railway transit system run by Pecovasa Renfe Mercancías will operate with 16 wagons.
Its maximum length will be 500 metres and will allow for up to 184 vehicles to be carried at once.
In 2023, an 18-wagon train will begin operating that will be able to handle up to 200 vehicles at once.
The year 2024 will see a hybrid locomotive start operating on the rail track, allowing for 100% electric transportation.
A go-ahead from the European Medicines Agency: Pfizer's Covid vaccine is safe for children aged 5 to 11
The European Medicines Agency announced on Thursday that the vaccination of children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine Comirnaty is now authorised.
Until now, this vaccine was only allowed for children over the age of 12.
The dosage of the Pfizer Covid vaccine meant for children aged 5 to 11 is three times smaller than the regular amount (10 µg instead of 30 µg).
The children's vaccination procedure is similar to the regular one, with two shots administered and a three-week interval in between.
The results of a clinical study of 2000 children showed that children aged 5 to 11 developed the same immunity as older age groups with a dose three times smaller.
The side effects included the same as experienced by older age groups but of a lesser or medium strength, and receded in only a few days.
This is why the European Medicines Agency has reached the conclusion that the benefits of administering children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the vaccine overshadow the risks.
The Agency will forward its recommendation to the European Commission, which will have the final say on whether to authorise the vaccine.
Marje Oone, a member of the state immunoprophylaxis expert committee, told Estonian Public Broadcasting that the Commission is likely to make a decision sometime next week.
"The European Medicines Agency has now given its approval, and we know that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also gave approval some time ago.
Considering the United States' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices gave its permission some time ago and there are already over three million children vaccinated, I don't see why the authorisation shouldn't be granted.
But the matter has not been discussed yet," Dr Oona said.
