Dave Chappelle doesn't back down when students at DC alma mater slam him as 'bigot' at surprise visit
Comedian Dave Chappelle made a surprise visit to his alma mater in Washington, D.C., where some students reportedly expected him to apologize following blowback over his popular "The Closer" comedy special on Netflix this year.
"I'm 16 and I think you're childish, you handled it like a child," a student said, adding that Chappelle is a "bigot," Politico Playbook reported Thursday after speaking to attendees of the event.
"My friend, with all due respect, I don’t believe you could make one of the decisions I have to make on a given day," he responded, according to students recounting the event.
Chappelle has faced years of backlash and claims that he is "transphobic" for jokes in his stand-up acts, including after "The Closer," where he made comments such as "gender is a fact," was released on Netflix last month.
The special was panned by the trans community and some employees of Netflix but boasts high ratings among general audiences.
He made an appearance at D.C.’s Duke Ellington School of the Arts on Tuesday, where 580 students packed the auditorium, according to Politico Playbook.
The comedian graduated from the school in 1991.
The school initially moved his appearance from Nov. 23 to April 22 over threats of students walking out in protest before apparently going back to the original plan.
Politico reported that he responded to another antagonistic question from a student: "I’m better than every instrumentalist, artist, no matter what art you do in this school, right now, I’m better than all of you.
I’m sure that will change.
I’m sure you’ll be household names soon."
"Your comedy kills," another student shouted at him.
