Expedia stops selling holidays that include experiences with captive dolphins and whales
Following changes to Expedia's animal welfare policy, the company said "attractions and activities that involve performances by or interactions with dolphins and other cetaceans will no longer be available on our sites".
Travel company Expedia has stopped selling holidays that involve performances by dolphins and whales in captivity.
Expedia Group said: "We recently adjusted our animal welfare policy.
"As a result, attractions and activities that involve performances by or interactions with dolphins and other cetaceans will no longer be available on our sites."
A spokesman told the Mail on Sunday that the company will continue to sell tickets to "seaside sanctuaries that provide captive animals with a permanent seaside living environment" if they "are accredited and do not feature interactions or performances".
The firm said the change will take time to implement and it intends to complete the process by early 2022.
