Retailers putting up prices at fastest pace since 1990 as consumers splash out early for Christmas
A CBI report found that "Christmas seems to have come early" for stores with shoppers looking to stock up for the festive season for fear of missing out due to supply chain snags.
Retailers are putting up prices at the fastest rate since 1990 according to industry figures that add to evidence of a cost of living squeeze this winter.
A CBI survey also suggested that sales have been boosted by consumers starting their Christmas shopping early because of fears over supply disruption.
Clothing and department stores saw "big upward swings" in November, the report found.
The figures, while providing cheer for high streets, also represent the latest sign of households facing bigger spending outlays after surging energy bills and fuel costs drove inflation to its highest level in a decade last month.
In the three months to November, the balance of retailers reporting higher selling prices stood at +77%, according to the CBI.
That was the highest level since May 1990.
Prices are expected to rise at a broadly similar pace next month, the survey added.
