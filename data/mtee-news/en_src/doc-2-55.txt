Demonizing Black victims is an old racist trope that didn't work for defense attorneys this time
Ahmaud Arbery was the victim.
But for weeks, he was painted as a brute and a thug in the trial of the three White men who killed him.
This tactic isn't new, but rather the latest example in a long history of court cases that criminalize and dehumanize Black victims.
Emmett Till.
Jordan Davis.
Trayvon Martin.
Botham Jean.
George Floyd -- all of them Black, all of them victims, just as Arbery was.
Arbery's family can now feel a sense of justice after Gregory McMichael, Travis McMichael and William "Roddie" Bryan Jr. were convicted on Wednesday, but that outcome is a rare exception to the rule.
"I wouldn't want to see no daddy watch their kid get lynched and shot down like that.
So it's all our problem.
Let's keep fighting.
Let's keep doing and making this a better place for all human beings.
All human beings," Marcus Arbery Sr. said after the reading of the verdict.
Race and racial tensions were clearly on display inside and outside the Georgia courtroom where the three men were tried, even as both the defense and the prosecution shied away from those discussions.
Instead, the jury heard from the defense a number of racist dog whistles.
From assertions that Black pastors might frighten jurors to a remark about Arbery's "long, dirty toenails," the defense's strategy was rife with rhetoric that sought to dehumanize and devalue Black Americans.
"What I saw was the defense preying on White fears," said Carol Anderson, a historian and the chair of African American studies at Emory University.
"The 'long, dirty toenails' -- that is an old trope of the 'Black Beast.'
That is the stuff coming out of Reconstruction and Jim Crow."
