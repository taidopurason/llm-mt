Tesla: Hundreds locked out of cars after server outage
Some 500 users of Tesla electric cars were unable to connect to their vehicles, with Elon Musk saying the company's mobile application "should be coming back online now".
Around 500 Tesla car owners were unable to connect to their vehicles due to an app server outage.
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, said on Friday that the company's mobile application was coming back online after the outage.
He tweeted in response to a Tesla owner who said he was experiencing a "500 server error" in connecting his Model 3 through the iOS app in Seoul, South Korea.
"Should be coming back online now," Mr Musk said.
"Looks like we may have accidentally increased verbosity of network traffic."
Around 500 Tesla users reported facing an error around 9.40pm GMT, according to outage monitoring website Downdetector.
There were over 60 reports as of 2.20am GMT.
