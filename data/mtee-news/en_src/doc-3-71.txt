What is the future of the cop drama?
Crime dramas and police procedurals are some of the most popular types of TV, but with trust in authorities waning and audience expectations changing, what could be the future of the genre?
You know this scene, you've watched it a thousand times before: the maverick police officer, who breaks the rules but gets the job done, hands over their badge to a disgruntled superior.
This trope has been hardwired into the TV cop drama, or police procedural, one of television's oldest and most dominant genres, which accounts for (according to research undertaken in 2020 by The Hollywood Reporter) almost a fifth of all scripted series on US network television.
It is also hugely popular elsewhere, with dramas like Line of Duty and Vigil booming in popularity in the UK.
In almost every example of the "hand over your badge" scene, the audience is asked to sympathise not with the by-the-book boss – insisting on accountability and due process – but the protocol-breaking cop.
The conditioning of viewers to root for the law-enforcing protagonist, no matter what, speaks to one of many problems some see as endemic in the cop drama: the vast majority of these productions offering flattering depictions of the police.
