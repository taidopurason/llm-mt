Seth Rogen goes viral after shrugging off Los Angeles car burglaries: 'It’s called living in a big city'
Comedic actor Seth Rogen sparked a Twitter frenzy after he shrugged off Los Angeles criminals breaking into cars, suggesting it's simply part of normal life in a big city.
The viral uproar began when the "Knocked Up" star reacted to a tweet from YouTube personality Casey Neistat, who wrote on Wednesday, "so our cars got robbed this morning because Los Angeles is a crime riddled 3rd world s---hole of a city" and expressed gratitude towards the LA Police Department for arresting the criminal and retrieving all the stolen belongings.
"Dude I’ve lived here for over 20 years.
You’re nuts haha," Rogen reacted.
"It’s lovely here.
Don’t leave anything valuable in it.
It’s called living in a big city."
"i can still be mad tho right?"
Neistat asked, adding, "feel so violated."
"You can be mad but I guess I don’t personally view my car as an extension of myself and I’ve never really felt violated any of the 15 or so times my car was broken in to," Rogen responded.
"Once a guy accidentally left a cool knife in my car so if it keeps happening you might get a little treat."
