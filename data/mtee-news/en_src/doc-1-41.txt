Fairfax County schools reinstates books with explicit images, claiming they don't include pedophilia
Fairfax County Public Schools reinstated two books that parents have condemned as obscene and pedophilic, claiming that two committees of school administrators, librarians, parents, and students determined that the books did not contain pedophilia and did not violate regulations by including obscene material.
Parents condemned the move in comments to Fox News.
"Lawn Boy" by Jonathan Evison includes long sections of a boy reminiscing about explicit experiences he had at 10 years old and "Gender Queer: A Memoir," by Maia Kobabe includes photos of sexual acts between a boy and a man.
Fairfax County Public Schools announced that it had restored the books to libraries after two committees reviewed them.
One committee found that "Lawn Boy" includes themes that "are affirming for students" with marginalized identities.
"There is no pedophilia in the book," the committee added.
The other committee found that "Gender Queer" depicts "difficulties nonbinary and asexual individuals may face."
The committee concluded that "the book neither depicts nor describes pedophilia."
"The robust committee process took place over several weeks and considered whether the books flouted regulations by being obscene or harmful to juveniles as defined by the Code of Virginia," FCPS noted in the press release.
"After careful consideration, neither books were deemed to have fallen foul of these regulations."
Stacy Langton, the Fairfax County mother who confronted the school board with images from the books in September, told Fox News that the FCPS report is "very intellectually dishonest."
"Unless FCPS is using a different dictionary, pedophilia means adults having sex with children, and that is precisely what is being depicted in the particular panel in Gender Queer," Langton told Fox News in an interview on Tuesday.
