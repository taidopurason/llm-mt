Kamala Harris reportedly spent over $500 on cookware in Parisian shop amid US economic uncertainty
Vice President Kamala Harris spent over $500 on cookware in a Parisian shop amid rising inflation and economic uncertainty at home in the U.S.
The vice president visited the shop on her four-day diplomatic trip to Paris last week, reportedly dropping 516 euros on pots and pans at high-end cookware store E. Dehillerin.
The store is located outside of the world-famous Louvre museum, where the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, the Mona Lisa, hangs.
Harris took home a serving dish costing around $375, a frying pan around $160, as well as a multitude of other kitchenware items, including a porcelain egg dish and a copper cleaner, according to the store, which disclosed the amount of the purchase to the Washington Free Beacon.
By comparison, a Mauviel copper saucepan carried by luxury brand Williams Sonoma -- based in Harris’ home state of California – is priced between $200 and $285.
After her stop into E. Dehillerin, Harris was asked by reporters about how her trip to France has prepared her for the presidency.
The vice president, who looked at the reporter with an expression of surprise, did not directly answer the question but instead touted the success of her diplomatic mission.
"I will tell you it was a very productive and a good trip," she said, adding that the U.S. has "a lot of follow up to do."
