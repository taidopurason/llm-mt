What is the Online Safety Bill and why are some people worried about it?
A draft of the bill is being scrutinised before it is formally introduced to parliament.
While some have welcomed its provisions to protect children, others have criticised it as a "censor's charter".
Following the murder of Sir David Amess and an arrest after another MP was emailed a death threat, senior figures in Westminster are decrying the abuse directed towards politicians over the internet.
Parliament is currently scrutinising the proposed solution to these abusive messages, the draft Online Safety Bill, which aims to establish a new way to regulate online content - covering not just abusive messages but all harmful material online, from bullying through to pornography.
It has the support of England's Children's Commissioner and the NSPCC, but some are concerned the law will end up introducing more problems than it solves.
They have criticised the current draft for its potential to have a chilling effect on free speech and hand censorship powers to the government.
What does the Online Safety Bill aim to do?
The Online Safety Bill will introduce obligations on companies to keep their users safe.
That safety is defined in broad terms.
It covers material that is already illegal under English law (such as images of child abuse) as well as material that is considered legal but harmful.
Technology companies will also be required to protect their users' rights to freedom of expression and privacy.
