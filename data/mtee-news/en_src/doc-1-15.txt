Channel deaths: People smugglers touting openly on Facebook
Sky News has uncovered a network of smugglers posting routes into Europe openly on social media.
Finding a route across the channel is as easy as typing "smuggler" into Facebook.
Far from being a hidden world, Sky News has found that a network of smugglers is operating openly on the social media platform.
Routes into Europe and the UK are regularly highlighted, with posts featuring images of the Union Jack and Big Ben.
One smuggler even claimed he would be able to make customers a British passport.
It comes as 27 people died while attempting to cross the Channel, one of the worst death tolls in recent years.
