Thanksgiving canceled?
Liberals who say America's holiday promotes genocide and White supremacy
Liberal pundits and news outlets across the country are using Thanksgiving week to disparage the holiday and label it a function of White supremacy and genocide.
"What is Thanksgiving to Indigenous people?
'A day of mourning'" a USA Today headline on Tuesday said, accompanied by an article that claimed "many" Americans believe the holiday "represents the dark shadow of genocide."
A weather service, Currently, posted an article Tuesday suggesting that Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving are "hurting" the Native American community.
"Thanksgiving will be celebrated by many people across the country," the tweet said.
"The holiday perpetuates in a false narrative, that spins the true history of genocide and colonization into a light and largely false story."
On MSNBC over the weekend, Gyasi Ross, who is Native American, explained a segment that white people have created a fake story around Thanksgiving and that the pilgrims are responsible for a system of White supremacy that is used to carry out "state sponsored" violence against Black people to this day.
