WWE star Seth Rollins describes 'terrifying' fan attack
WWE superstar Seth Rollins said the fan attack at Raw on Monday night was a "terrifying" experience.
Rollins was walking to the back after a match with Finn Balor at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, when a fan came out of nowhere and speared him.
The fan was quickly tackled by referees and security and removed from the arena.
The man was identified as Elisah Spencer, 24, and he was charged with two offenses.
Rollins recalled the attack in an interview with TMZ Sports on Tuesday.
"It happened very quickly.
I was mostly just reacting and hoping that our security would come and do their job.
Which they did very quickly.
And then was just trying to detach and move on.
Hope that everybody is OK," he said.
The NYPD said Rollins suffered a swolen lip.
"No, no serious injuries.
Nothing like that.
I was safe, we were safe.
Everything was OK," he added.
Spencer, of Brooklyn, is accused of leaving his seating section and jumping the barrier to attack Rollins.
He faces charges of attempted assault and attempted violation of arts and cultural affairs (disrupting live sporting event), police said.
