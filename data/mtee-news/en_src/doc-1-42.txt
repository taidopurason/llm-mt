Waukesha parade attack: Meet the official who agreed to $1K bail for Darrell Brooks ahead of Christmas carnage
Waukesha parade suspect Darrell Brooks’ release on just $1,000 bail weeks before the deadly attack prompted Milwaukee’s district attorney to announce an investigation into his own office’s request for such a low sum.
But it was a court commissioner, not a low-level prosecutor, who agreed and cleared the way for Brooks' release.
Court documents identify Cedric Cornwall as the commissioner present at Brooks' arraignment.
He did not respond to emails seeking an explanation, and no one picked up multiple calls to a phone listed under his name.
Numerous experts, including former prosecutors, police officers and defense attorneys, told Fox News Digital that Brooks’ bail seemed too low for the crime: allegedly punching a woman, stealing her phone and running her over with the same SUV believed to have been used weeks later to cause carnage at a family-oriented holiday parade.
He also had charges for another firearms felony pending an active warrant out of Nevada and a record of skipping bail.
