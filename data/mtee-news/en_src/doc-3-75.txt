Stressed by parenting?
Evolution can explain why
What can ants and meerkats teach us about parenting?
Evolutionary biologist Nichola Raihani uncovers the ancient social instincts that still shape our families today.
I wrestled the remote control off my children and perched on the sofa, bracing myself for what was coming.
It was March 2020, and caseloads of a novel and dangerous coronavirus were rising quickly here in the UK.
Our Prime Minister was about to announce a lockdown.
Schools and nurseries were going to close.
Like millions of other parents, I was about to become my young children's de facto school teacher.
The idea filled me with dread.
I wasn't the only one feeling that way.
My phone buzzed as messages flooded the school WhatsApp channel, with parents wondering how they were going to fit the demands of their day jobs around fronted adverbials and long division.
Over the months that followed, many parents felt a crushing toll on their mental and physical health.
More lockdowns and school closures ensued, along with reports of a worrying increase in levels of parental stress, anxiety and depression.
Many asked themselves why this was so hard.
Shouldn't we be naturally good at raising our young without outside help?
Didn't humans cope without schools and daycare in the past, after all?
As an evolutionary biologist, I do not hold the answers to all pandemic-related family crises, but I can say one thing for certain: as a species, humans are spectacularly ill-equipped to deal with parenting in isolation.
