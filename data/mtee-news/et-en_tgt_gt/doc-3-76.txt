European Commission: Vaccination certificates apply for 9 months, for an indefinite period of time to travel
The European Commission has recently proposed to the Member States to establish deadlines for the validity of vaccination certificates to passengers between the European Union countries.
The proposal is that the standard term of the vaccination certificate issued after the primary vaccination cycle should be at least 9 months.
This means that Member States should not refuse to recognize the vaccination certificate in the inspection of passengers, which confirms that less than 9 months have passed since the last dose of primary vaccination.
As far as the development doses are concerned, according to the Commission's proposal, the 9-month expiry date should not be applied to the evidence issued after the development dose.
This means that, at least for the time being, the evidence obtained after the development dose should apply to an indefinite period.
â€œIt is possible that after the development dose, the protection will last longer than after the initial vaccination, which is why the Commission closely monitors new scientific data on this issue.
Based on this, the Commission may later propose that the appropriate validity of the vaccination certificates have been issued after the enhancement dose, "the Commission noted.
The Commission will propose to begin the application from January 10, 2022 to give the new order to implement the new regime.
The Commission's Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders noted at today's press conference that only vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency are accepted, and thus, for example, the evidence issued in Hungary, where people have been administered to Russian Sputnik or Chinese vaccines.
To date, more than 650 million vaccinations have been issued in the EU.
The Commission also found that a person with a valid EU digital COVID certificate should not apply to the general rule of testing, quarantine or other additional restrictions.
People who do not have an EU digital COVI certificate could be allowed to travel before or after a test.
The EU traffic light is updated as follows: The new case indicator will be viewed with the level of vaccination in the area.
In the case of passengers from green areas, no restrictions should be applied.
On the other hand, in the case of dark red areas, the large number of infected people should be advised to refrain from traveling in one direction and another, and from passengers who are not vaccinated or suffered from the disease should require testing and quarantine.
Exceptions should be applied to cross-border pendulum migrants, children under the age of 12 and people with inevitable travel needs.
According to the Commission, the list of people with an inevitable travel need should be restricted, as many of the current passengers currently listed have had the opportunity to vaccinate themselves.
