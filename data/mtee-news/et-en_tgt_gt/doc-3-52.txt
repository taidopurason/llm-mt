John Varese's sad fate: was it suicide or was he removed from life?
Did John shot himself mainly because of being smarter than death?
Or was he forced or intimidated by suicide?
Or was removed from life because it started not physically but mentally ...
Peeter Olesk discusses the life and death of Vares-Barbarus in his last piece.
When Johannes Vares, as a poet Johannes Barbarus (Jan 12, 1890-29 Nov. 1946), was found as a poet in the early morning, of course he did not drive his beard pocket knife, but probably with a razor, some cream and whipped brush.
It could not be difficult and painful in the morning, because he probably had a beard every day, but of course he had several varieties of Cologne waters at the mirror, and the liquids of the cutting bloodstream were also found.
The question is whether he wrote two pre -death letters before or after going to the mirror, the chin has already been shaved.
The answer to the question raised would help us explain what time John Vares went to sleep on the morning of death on the morning of death, how much time he had to write goodbye and where he did it.
Desk, white sheets of paper, ink pot and pen are not ordinary things in the bathroom!
It takes about an hour to write two quite long and extremely personal letters.
It could take about twenty minutes for shaving, braving and rinsing the oral cavity, but what John Vares could not know was the length of the time, after which he would have been sought and who finds his body first.
Given these circumstances, I tend to think that farewell letters were ready before death, no later than the previous day.
Consequently, they were written consciously, not affective.
According to Nigol Andresen's oral announcement, Johannes Vares did not want to live as a disabled at the end of his life.
From this it could be concluded that he knew the course of his illness.
However, the word "disabled" does not necessarily mean a noticeable disability, which may also mean a loss of ability to work or from work as a pretext for health reasons.
