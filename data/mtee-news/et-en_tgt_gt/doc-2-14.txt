CHINESE MEDICINE RECOMMENDS: This plant should be in every home now!
In the autumn and winter, when it is drizzly and humid outside, it is necessary to strengthen and warm the body.
Several herbs are suitable for this, which keep the heat inside, but do not allow excessive heat to occur.
It is very convenient to put both plants and hot water in a thermos, take it with you to work or school and drink tea that supports the body during the day, recommends the Tervise Alkeemia blog.
When the tea runs out, boiling water can be added to the plants several times.
