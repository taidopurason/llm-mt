Mart Seim: I am the only super heavy weight lifter who competed in the Rio Olympics and has not been caught with banned substances
Estonia's most successful weightlifter Mart Seim and his brother-in-law Leho Pent are preparing for the World Championship starting in two weeks.
If their favorite sport remains on the Olympic schedule, both want to compete at least until the 2024 Paris Games.
This summer's aspiration to the Tokyo Olympics was interrupted by the corona virus contracted in the spring, which confined both Mardi and Leho to a sick bed and prevented them from regaining their athletic form for the EC.
