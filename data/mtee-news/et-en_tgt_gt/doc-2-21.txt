Mart Seim: I have competed in the Rio Olympics the only one of the high -weighted weightlifters who has not been missed with banned substances
Mart Seim, the most successful lifter in Estonia, and his counterpart Leho Pent, are preparing for the starting World Championship in two weeks.
If their favorite fish is still in the Olympic program, they both want to compete in the Paris Games at least 2024.
This summer, the Tokyo Olympics aspiration was dashed by a coronavirus in the spring, which chained both Mardi and Leho in the bed and did not allow the EM to restore the sporty form.
