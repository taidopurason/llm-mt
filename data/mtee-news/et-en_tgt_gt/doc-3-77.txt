"Based on the law, it can be assumed that obtaining a permit for use in the European Union, NATO or OECD external state manufacturer hardware and software may be significantly more complex than the manufacturer, whose headquarters are in the Member State of the above organizations," said Ben Chang Bin, Head of Huawei Technologies Estonia.
According to Huawei's statement, the assumption of the hardware and software manufacturer used in the communications network is not justified to a particular state, as all large companies operate internationally and their supply chains are similar to each other.
According to the company, the security of technology can also be ensured by "transparent and proportionate measures, avoiding unjustified discrimination and competition without damaging the market participants".
Pursuant to the new version of the Electronic Communications Act, the Building Code and the State Fees Act Act, the Government has the right to establish an obligation for the communications operator to apply for permission to use the communications network to ensure national security.
This permit also passes through security agencies.
