German scientists train cattle to use the toilet.
The results can make a world of difference
A small herd of cattle in Germany has learned an impressive habit.
They use the fenced off artificial grass area as a toilet.
But why is such training necessary?
Worldwide, about 10% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions come from cattle.
German scientists are trying to develop an incredible solution to make cattle farming more environmentally friendly.
