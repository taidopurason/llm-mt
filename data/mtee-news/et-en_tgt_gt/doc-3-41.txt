The government made an exception: more spectators are allowed for the Estonia-Israel selection match
The government considered the men's World Cup qualifying match between the national teams of Estonia and Israel to be held this Sunday in Saku Suurhalli in Tallinn as an event of overwhelming social interest and allows up to 3,360 spectators to the game.
According to the current restrictions, from November 15, up to 1,000 spectators may participate in indoor sports competitions.
The Health Board will support the event with an increased number of spectators if the organizer mitigates the risk of the spread of the coronavirus according to the submitted plan, the government announced on its website.
Spectators would be divided into four zones in Saku Suurhalli, and they would not come into contact with each other, the players, or the personnel serving the game.
Entry to the event is only possible upon presentation of a proof of COVID and mask wearing will be checked on site.
In the sectors, it has been taken into account that people are spread out and separate ventilation is ensured for each area.
The use of horns and the like is prohibited.
The Estonian Basketball Association gives advance notice so that spectators arrive at the game in time to avoid queues at the entrance when checking evidence and documents.
Doors open one hour before the start of the event.
A total of 14 different entrances are open on four levels.
The Estonian national team will start the 2023 World Cup selection series on Thursday evening, facing Germany in Nuremberg.
