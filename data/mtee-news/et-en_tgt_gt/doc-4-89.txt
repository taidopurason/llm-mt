Twenty -seven migrants killed in the English channel were immediately thrown into the propaganda mill
The death of twenty -seven migrants in the Autumn La Manche Strait is undoubtedly a major tragedy, but the liberal West immediately threw it into its propaganda, largely to justify its inaction.
France was the most Phariser, with President Emmanuel Macron warned British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the political purposes of the migration crisis, referring to the La Manche Strait, who claimed the lives of 27 people.
Before that, however, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed on Wednesday in a telephone conversation to boost action against the death of a dead sea.
"Both leaders were explicit that today's tragic loss of living was sharply reminded that it was important to keep all the options on the table to stop these lethal crossing and break the business model of the criminal gangs behind them," said the British government spokesman.
Britain is a country where these people are aspiring to and France is a transit country from which they all rush through unobstructed and where they live in tent camps, waiting for human traffickers - Paris should have all levers to prevent migrants from using the country as a jumping platform, not to mention blocking the La Manche StraitTo.
The British do not want them, the French do not - what are the obstacles to closing the migration path?
Five people have been arrested in the La Manche Strait, which demanded at least 27 people's lives on Wednesday, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on Thursday.
According to Lille's prosecutor, 17 men, seven women and three minors died in a boat drowned near the northern coast of France on Wednesday.
The four suspects in human smuggling were arrested on Wednesday afternoon, Darmanin explained.
The French authorities did not save the words to express their alleged weakness, whereas human traffickers would not be able to act as a state support - and this support must be both Manche's migration path (which could be closed) and human trafficking is a favorable soil by allowing mass migration as a national policyTo.
President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday night that France would not let the La Manche Strait become a "cemetery" and promised that the authorities would find those responsible for this tragedy.
French prosecutors initiated a murder investigation.
The President does not consider himself the culprit, although it is during his rule that France has flowed full of migrants.
French Interior Minister Gerald Darman called for a "harsh international response".
He said that four people suspected of being directly involved in what happened have been arrested.
"The criminal nature of the smugglers organizing these crossings cannot be sufficiently condemned," he added.
"This disaster is a tragedy," Prime Minister Jean Castex whispered.
"My thoughts are with the missing and the victims who fell victim to the criminals of abusive criminals."
The Pharislate stories of French authorities do not prevent human trafficking and drowning deaths.
