Ülo Kalm: A new powerful hospital was allowed in the elections.
Money comes from Brussels, but where do employees and equipment come from?
How can a mayor whose father Ülo and his mother Liidia can manage a multi -ethnic city?
Sadly, the faith of former mayor Savisaar was that trust was eternal and he again nominated as a candidate for the ambassador.
The star was gone.
As trust is already more important than language and nationality, the election result in Narva shows.
Doctors have to fight the salt -blowers who offer opinions instead of facts.
In addition, gentlemen who do not trust our hospital system have also appeared in the Ramp light (more specifically the leaf columns).
I just read a citizen of a citizen of survival in Perh.
