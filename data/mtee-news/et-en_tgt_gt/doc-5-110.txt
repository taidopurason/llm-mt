Green Fire of the European Medicines Agency: Pfizer corona vaccine is suitable for children aged 5-11
On Thursday, the European Medicines Agency recommended that the Pfizer/Biontech coronate vaccine Comiraty permit for children aged 5-11.
Until now, the vaccine was allowed for 12 -year -olds and older.
The dose of Pfizer corona vaccine for children aged 5-11 is three times lower than the usual dose (10 µg compared to 30 µg).
As in the older age group, the vaccine course for children is done in two injections with three weeks apart.
A clinical study with 2000 children showed that 5-11 year olds received three times less immune responses to the same amount of immune responses as older age groups with full dose.
The side effects were similar to the older age group and were mild or moderate and retreated within a few days.
As a result, the European Medicines Agency concluded that the benefits of the vaccine in children aged 5-11 years of age exceed the risks.
The Agency is now a recommendation to the European Commission, which makes the final decision on the use of the vaccine.
Marje Oona, a member of the National Immunoprophylaxis Committee, told the ERR that the Commission will probably make a decision on this issue next week.
“As the European Medicines Agency's (mother) approval is there, we know that the approval of the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been in place for some time.
The United States Immunization Committee has already made this recommendation quite a bit ago and has already been vaccinated in the United States, so I don't really see it very reason to be given.
But we haven't discussed it yet, ”commented Dr Oona.
