Green light from the European Medicines Agency: Pfizer's corona vaccine is suitable for children aged 5-11
On Thursday, the European Medicines Agency recommended extending the Pfizer/BioNTech corona vaccine Comirnaty's license to children aged 5-11.
Until now, the vaccine was allowed for 12-year-olds and older.
The dose of Pfizer's corona vaccine for children aged 5-11 years is three times lower than the usual dose (10 µg compared to 30 µg).
As in the older age group, the vaccine course is given to children as two injections three weeks apart.
A clinical trial of 2,000 children showed that 5-11 year olds got the same immune responses with three times the lower dose than older age groups with the full dose.
Side effects were similar to those in the older age group and were mild to moderate and resolved within a few days.
Therefore, the European Medicines Agency concluded that the benefits of the vaccine in children aged 5-11 outweigh the risks.
The agency will now send a recommendation to the European Commission, which will make the final decision on the use of the vaccine.
Marje Oona, a member of the national immunoprophylaxis expert committee, told ERR that the committee will probably make a decision on this issue next week.
“Since the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval is there, we know that the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval has been there for some time.
The United States Committee on Immunization has already made this recommendation quite some time ago, and over three million children in the United States have already been vaccinated, so I really don't see much reason why it shouldn't be given.
But we haven't discussed it yet," commented Dr. Oona.
