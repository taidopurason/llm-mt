The family doctor warns: the flu is on the move!
It is a serious illness, it is not just a cold and a cough.
How to protect yourself?
There is a lot of talk about the coronavirus, its prevention and treatment.
In addition to this, we tend to forget that there are many different respiratory viruses on the move in the autumn-winter season, and the flu has already arrived in Estonia, so it's high time to protect ourselves from the virus, says Triinu-Mari Ots, head of the Camp Family Medical Center and family doctor, giving advice on how to recognize the fluand for prevention.
The typical Estonian autumn-winter cough-runny-sore throat season has begun, when acute viral infections of the upper respiratory tract caused by various viruses are mainly on the move.
"The most common agents are rhinovirus, RS virus, adenovirus and parainfluenza.
The general name of these diseases is acute respiratory viral infections, and in their case, a specific symptom is treated, be it a cough, sore throat, runny nose or headache," says Triinu-Mari Ots.
The exception is the influenza virus, the course of which is very specific and which can be determined by the symptoms already in the first days of illness.
"In this case, analyzes are also taken to provide laboratory confirmation of the presence of the influenza virus," says the family doctor.
This is important both for prescribing treatment and for preventing or limiting outbreaks in, for example, a work group, gym or school.
