Paul Oja: Greyest visions of the future in Tom Clancy scream novels also talked about pandemic
In the 1960s, Soviet science fiction gradually began to break out of purely technical details of carving or fighting pests.
On the one hand, bright visions of humanity's happy communist future began to be constructed (Ivan Jefremov's "Andromeda Collection" 1957, Arkadi and Boris Strugatski's "Nine" 1962), on the other hand, dystopias, or dystopias from Western Capitalism, were condemned.
Most of the time they were still breathed: "In 2000…!"
What is everything and what comes ... As we know, the Soviet communism, along with its bright vision of the future, disappeared into the black hole of history before that magical year.
However, the sharp -glow Western writers still provide thought with their creations.
Tom Clancy, a skillful and fertile cultivator of technical screaming literature, kept a sharp look at the events of the world.

Little by little, however, Tom Clancy and the material he was in hand began to change.
The attentive monitoring of world development trends made it possible to predict some of the events - unfortunately in the form of black scenarios, which sadly tend to become a reality of the thrill.
At the end of the novel Debt of Honor ("Award"), a white house with a large passenger aircraft is raming the terrorist just when the congress session is held with the president's attendance.
The novel was published in 1994;We know well what happened on September 9, 2001.
