DISTANCE EDUCATION IN TALLINNA WAS SENSELESS!
The rapid testing of schools gave the same good result!
Tallinn schools 4.-8.the four-week distance learning of the classes did not give the city an advantage in fighting the corona, because the rapid tests achieved the same result in areas with open schools, dry figures confirm.
Distance learning also took place in Pärnu and partly in Narva for a short time, but in Tallinn it started right after the school holidays and lasted for four weeks.
Scientists analyzing the corona now have an excellent comparison base between Tallinn and the rest of Estonia.
After the future state exams, for example, it will be possible to see whether four weeks of absence from school means worse results compared to the rest of the country.
However, the most important question now is whether Tallinn's decision to direct municipal schools to long-distance learning gave the city greater success in the fight against corona.
After all, there was friction between Toompea and the lower city due to the actions of the mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
