Tallinn's distance training was meaningless!
The quick testing of schools gave the same good result!
Tallinn schools 4-8.The four -week distance training of the classes did not give the city an advantage in the control of the corona, as fast tests achieved an equivalent result in open -school regions, the dry numbers confirm.
For a shorter period of time, distance training was also held in Pärnu and partly in Narva, but in Tallinn it started immediately after school holidays and stretches for up to four weeks.
For researchers analyzing corona, the rest of Estonia has now formed a great reference base in Tallinn.
After the future state exams, for example, one can look at whether the absence of four weeks of school also means poorer results compared to the rest of the country.
At the moment, however, the most important question is whether Tallinn's decision to direct municipal schools to long distance training gave the city more success in the fight against the corona.
After all, there was a rubbing between Toompea and the sub-city due to the activities of Mayor Mikhail Kõlvart.
