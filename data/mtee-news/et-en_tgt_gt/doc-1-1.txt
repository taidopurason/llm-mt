Supreme Court: Government General Organizations cannot be so extensive
Government general organizations, which have various restrictions and rules during the corona pledge, should be of more restricted extent, said Supreme Court Judge Ivo Pilving.
"We referred to one border and the Tallinn Circuit Court has already pointed out that the general organizations of the governments - which have all the requirements for the corona passport today - that their limits must be expired once.
Because the nature of the general organization is also that its legal action must still be limited.
He cannot be as universal as one law.
And if he is not otherwise restricted, for example, for a group of certain persons or something like that, he must be limited in time, "Pilving, chairman of the Supreme Court Administrative Chamber, said at a press conference on Thursday.
"At the moment, there is no view of whether this time is over or tomorrow or the day after tomorrow - this is already in the courts, and this truth will be revealed.
But somewhere there is also a limit to the government of using this instrument, and here the applicants' criticism is to some extent that the legislator cannot realize himself from these issues, "Pilving continued
The general organization of the government is a special type of administrative act, which can only be challenged in court in court only individually, and the corresponding judgment does not extend to all objects of the restriction, but only to the contested person.
Former Chancellor of Justice Allar JÃµks has criticized the widespread use of general orders.
At the same time, the judge emphasized that the dispute against which the Supreme Court was still different on Thursday.
"It concerns one - a very special, but still one institution, the Defense Forces - and here are a bit more relaxed rule -state frames, because it does not affect everyone.
This concerns the Estonian men and women working in the Defense Forces, and the head of the relevant body may, in the context of today's understanding, impose requirements under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, "said Pilving.
He explained that the current practice of the Supreme Court suggests that the more extensive, deeper, intense the restriction or obligation, the more work it must be done by Parliament.
"Until some of the obligations are that must be finally regulated by law," the Supreme Court noted.
"But on the other hand, the topic of vaccination and a pandemic, which goes as waves and requires a quick response, it again speaks to the executive's decision -making power and the government's decision -making power.
And even if we are talking about the requirements of the institutions and the people of the people working in them, there is today's Supreme Court that there is also room for the directives of the heads of the agencies, if there is any circumstances, "he added.
