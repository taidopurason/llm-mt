Chief Justice: General orders of government cannot be so extensive
The government's general orders, which have established various restrictions and rules during the corona pandemic, should have a more limited scope, said state judge Ivo Pilving.
"We referred to one limit, and the Tallinn District Court has already referred to it, that of the general orders of the governments - with which all the requirements of the corona passport are established today - that their limit must end once.
Because the nature of the general arrangement is also that its legal scope must be somehow limited.
It cannot be as universal as a single law.
And if he is not limited in some other way, such as for a certain group of persons or something like that, then he must be limited in time," Pilving, the chairman of the Administrative Board of the Supreme Court, said at a press conference held on Thursday.
"It is not possible to take a position now, whether that time has already passed today or will pass tomorrow or the day after tomorrow - that's what these disputes are for in the courts, and the truth will be revealed there.
But somewhere there is a limit to the government's use of this instrument, and here the criticism of the complainants is also correct to a certain extent, that even the legislator cannot really distance himself from these issues," Pilving continued.
The government's general order is a special type of administrative act, by which restrictions imposed can be challenged in court only by each individual, and the corresponding judgment does not extend to all objects of the restriction, but only to the person who challenged it.
The widespread use of general orders has been criticized by former Chancellor of Justice Allar JÃµks.
At the same time, the supreme judge emphasized that the dispute regarding which the supreme court announced its decision on Thursday is different.
"It concerns one - although very special, but still one institution, the defense forces - and here the legal framework is a bit looser, because it does not concern everyone.
This concerns Estonian men and women working in the defense forces, and according to today's understanding, the head of the relevant institution can also impose requirements on the restricted circle of persons on the basis of the Occupational Health and Safety Act," said Pilving.
He explained that the practice of the Supreme Court so far suggests that the more extensive, deep, intense a certain restriction or obligation is, the more work Parliament has to do with it.
"Up to the point that some obligations are such that must be finally regulated by law," the state judge noted.
"But on the other hand, the subject of vaccination and the pandemic, which goes on in waves and where a quick response is needed, again speaks in favor of the decision-making power of the executive power and in favor of the government's decision-making right.
And also if we are talking about institutions and the [relationship] demands of the people working in them, according to today's Supreme Court's understanding, there is also room for directives from the heads of these institutions, if the circumstances are there," he added.
