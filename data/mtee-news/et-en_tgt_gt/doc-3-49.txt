Make your own candles with a small footprint
Whoever pours candles before the holidays should try Nordic and natural rapeseed wax.
Wax produced from rapeseed is a renewable and environmentally friendly raw material.
It's time to pour candles every fall.
Candles can also be made in spring and summer, but this activity is particularly suitable for autumn.
It is dark and rainy outside, the wind is blowing.
At the same time, candle wax melts in a pot on the stove and wonderful aromas fill the room.
These are magical moments.
Our ancestors made candles from precious sheep fat and used them only on special occasions.
Today, many different materials and tools are available for making candles.
Navigating them can be confusing.
