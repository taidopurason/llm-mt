Sony TVs are not meant just for watching TV channels, but with many additional apps they can also be used for all kinds of other entertainment, starting from YouTube and Netflix to special sports broadcasts, games and even social media, because they have Google TV as their operating system.
Now, with the "Black Sale", you can get some very good screens at an even better price.
Discounts reach up to one thousand euros.
Here are three decent offers, from which you will surely find something suitable for your needs.
You can see all the cheap TVs of the "Black Sale" on the campaign page of Sony Center.
Both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos make this model a good TV for movie nights.
Both the sound and the picture are of cinema-like quality, in addition, the 4K resolution and HDR offer a good contrasting picture.
However, 4K X-Reality PRO is necessary if you watch TV shows or videos whose quality does not correspond to a 4K screen.
Namely, Sony's image enhancement technology adjusts the image quality to be as close as possible to 4K.
With support for Apple AirPlay, Apple Homekit and Chromecast, you can connect other home devices to your smart TV without wires, streaming content over the network.
This model is currently available for 150 euros cheaper, or 19% less.
