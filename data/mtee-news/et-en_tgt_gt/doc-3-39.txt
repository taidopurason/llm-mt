"You can't say I'm not a woman."
A special sprint girl who passed 100 meters from the flight in 9.86 seconds
Naturally high testosterone Namibia sprinters Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masiling do not fit into the regular limits and are raising new questions.
During the Tokyo Olympics, Estonians were able to accompany Maicel Uibo's husband Shaunae Miller-Uibo when he successfully defended the 400-meter title.
The victory was overwhelming, but to be honest, all possible threats fell for one reason or another, and the slender Bahamane had to win.
Figuratively speaking, the road was cleaned with the gold medal.
Two years earlier, Bahrain's quarter-Mailer Salwa Eid Naser, who was surprised at the Miller-Uibo in the World Championships, was sentenced to punishment due to doping tests.
The new Super Talent, a new super-talent in America, chose my 800m distance, where he became the Olympic champion.
And this year's very busy times on the teenage Namibia sprinters (Christine Mboma ran 48.54 and Beatrice Masiling's 49.53) banned the World Athletics Association (WA) 400m because of too high testosterone levels.
But what happens next?
Mboma and Miling, who came second and sixth in Tokyo 200m, are still causing disagreement.
Nobody is happy.
Some think they have been discriminated against, some believe that this duo should not compete with women at all.
The topic requires a solution as soon as possible, as observers say it is only a matter of time before the very poor start but unprecedented end -speed Mboma's world records.
