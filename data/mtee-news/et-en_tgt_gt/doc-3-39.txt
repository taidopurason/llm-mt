"You can't say I'm not a woman."

Naturally high-testosterone Namibian sprinters Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi do not fit within the normal boundaries and raise more and more questions.
During the Tokyo Olympics, Estonians were able to support Maicel Uibo's wife, Shaunae Miller-Uibo, when she successfully defended her title in the 400-meter run.
The victory was overwhelming, but to be fair, all possible threats fell for one reason or another, and the slender Bahamian had to win.
Figuratively speaking, the path to the gold medal was cleared with a broom.
Two years earlier, the Bahraini quarter miler Salwa Eid Naser, who surprisingly took first place in front of Miller-Uibo at the Doha World Cup, was punished for failing doping tests.
19-year-old Athing Mu, a new super talent trained in America, chose the 800 m distance, where he became the Olympic champion.
And the teenage Namibian sprinters who showed very fast times this year (Christine Mboma ran a time of 48.54 and Beatrice Masilingi a time of 49.53) were banned by the World Athletics Association (WA) from participating in the 400m distance because of too high testosterone levels.
But what will become of them?
Mboma and Masilingi, who finished second and sixth in the 200m in Tokyo, are still divisive.
Nobody seems to be satisfied.
Some think that they have been discriminated against, some believe that this duo should not compete among women at all.
The issue requires a solution as soon as possible, because according to observers, it is only a matter of time when Mboma, with a very poor start, but an unprecedented final speed, will set world records.
