French fishermen block traffic in the English Channel to demand fishing rights
French fishermen will block ferry traffic in three English Channel ports and cargo traffic in the tunnel between France and Britain on Friday to demand post-Brexit fishing rights, a union said.
Gerard Romiti, chairman of the French National Committee for Fisheries (CNPMEM), described the protest as a warning shot and said traffic would be blocked at the ports of Saint-Malo, Ouistreham and Calais and the Eurotunnel for several hours.
Britain and France's months-long dispute over fishing licenses remains unresolved and threatens to escalate into a full-scale trade war.
â€œWe don't want donations, we just want our permits back.
The UK has to stick to the post-Brexit deal," Romiti said.
"We have been holding our breath for 11 months.
There are limits to the patience of professionals.
We hope that this warning shot will be heard," he said without ruling out further measures.
France has threatened to ban British fishing vessels from unloading their catch in French ports and impose stricter controls on all British imports.
According to President Emmanuel Macron, such measures are expected to give an opportunity for negotiations, but French officials emphasize that all options are still on the table.
Negotiations between French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune and British Brexit Minister David Frost have so far not borne fruit.
Under an agreement between Britain and the European Union last year, European fishing vessels can continue to fish in British waters if they can prove that they did so in the past.
According to Paris, the requests of several dozen French ships have been unjustifiably rejected.
London denies this.
