The British and France but lasting a dispute over fishing permits are still unsolved and threatens to escalate into a full -scale trade war.
"We don't want donations, we just want our promises back.
The United Kingdom must follow the post-Brexit agreement, "Romiti said.
"We've been holding our breath for 11 months.
There are limits on the suffering of professionals.
We hope that this warning shot will be heard, "he said without excluding further measures.
France has threatened to prohibit British fishing vessels to unload their prey in French ports and impose a stricter check for all British import goods.
According to President Emmanuel Macron, such measures are expected to give the opportunity to negotiate, but French officials emphasize that all options are still on the table.
The negotiations of David Frost, Minister of the French European Questions Minister and British Brexit, have not yet beared fruit.
According to Britain and the European Union, European fishing vessels can continue to catch British waters if they can prove that they did so sooner.
According to Paris, the requests of dozens of French ships have been rejected.
London denies it.
