Mihkel Raud from corona diings in social media: it's like 15 minutes of celebrity that makes it easy to lam from others
"Life is what comes when you have other plans," said one wise man once.
This man was probably John Lennon.
Although we tend to attribute the brilliant quotes to the people who we like the most, so it may happen that instead of Lennon, these wise words were spoken by someone else.
But the core of the sentence, of course, changes that.
I had beautiful plans.
I had to take Singer Vinger in Sindi, then take the bus back to Tallinn, and the next day, "Estonia is looking for a superstar" final show - just as I had been countless, traveling and participating in a dozen years.
But life came out of my plans.
"I don't feel very well, maybe we drive straight to the city?"I tried to give up Singer Vinger's companions from another forest stop.
We had already made three of them.
The bus turned under the forest, the men made smoke outside and I felt the fever rising every second.
And if you now think you've stumbled on another Covidi-Itku, you are only right.
