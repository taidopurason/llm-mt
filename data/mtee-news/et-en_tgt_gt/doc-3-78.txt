Mihkel Raud about corona attacks on social media: it's like 15 minutes of fame, based on which it's easy to get sympathy from others
"Life is what comes when you have other plans," a wise man once said.
That man must have been John Lennon.
Although we tend to attribute great quotes to the people we like the most, so it could be that someone else spoke those words of wisdom instead of Lennon.
But of course the core of the sentence changes little.
I had beautiful plans.
I had to perform with Singer Vinger in Sind, then take a bus back to Tallinn and participate in the final show of "Eesti otsib superstaraari" the next day - just as I had performed, traveled and participated countless times over a dozen years.
But life got ahead of my plans.
"I don't feel very well, maybe we'll go straight to the city?"I tried to dissuade Singer Vinger's companions from giving up another stop in the forest.
We had already made three of them.
The bus turned into the forest, the men were smoking outside, and I could feel the fever rising every second.
And now if you think you've stumbled upon another COVID cry, you're only half right.
