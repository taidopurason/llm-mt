Among the cars with the most rewind mileage, German elite brands lead
Rewinding the mileage reading is one of the most common scams in the used car market.
In this way, the price of the used vehicle is increased by dishonest methods and the value of the car is damaged.
A recent carVertical study found that buyers of German elite brands are at the highest risk of purchasing a car with a modified odometer reading.
TOP 10 models with the most frequently rewinded mileage: BMW M5 tops the list
To determine the list of cars with the most rolled back mileage, IT company carVertical analyzed the history of more than 700,000 used car reports generated between November 2020 and November 2021.
18 different markets were studied, including Poland, Romania, Hungary, France, Slovenia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Serbia, Germany, Croatia, Russia, United States and Italy.
Mileage data shows that the BMW M5 is the car with the most modified odometer reading;over a third of used vehicles were related to possible fraud.
This stand-alone statistic doesn't capture the extent of BMWs' odometer rewind problem â€” as CarVertical auto expert Matas Buzelis recently pointed out, the entire list is dominated by various BMW models:
"Half of the TOP 10 list is occupied by cars from this manufacturer.
The indicator is correlated with the demand for used BMWs in various markets.
The data also shows that more expensive cars are more likely to have modified mileage, and this fact must be taken into account when looking for a used vehicle.
This is where checking the car's odometer wears out."
BMW 7 Series and Subaru Outback are second and third in the list of cars with 33.4 and 31.8 percent, respectively.
The Audi A8 was the fifth most frequently cheated car, with its sportier sibling the A7 coming in tenth, with just over a quarter (25.8 per cent) of such vehicles having artificially reduced mileage, according to the survey.
Matas Buzelis explains that the more frequent representation of higher-class vehicles in the list of vehicles with a modified odometer reading is primarily due to the greater possible variety in the sale of such used cars.
Rewinding the odometer is a relatively cheap and easy method that gives dishonest car dealers an opportunity to make extra money.

Most car models with odometers rolled back by year of manufacture: older cars are more at risk of fraud
Research shows that it is important to check the mileage when buying a used car, especially for older vehicles.
The most popular models with modified odometer readings were produced between 2006 and 2016.
However, car expert Matas Buzelis emphasizes that there is a connection between the possibility of fraud and the price range of the car:
"The list of cars with the mileage read back most often consists mainly of elite class vehicles, but there are also popular car models, although their share is smaller than the total number of cars with modified mileage.
Subaru, Ford and Volkswagen cars are in the same age group as the higher class vehicles.
It seems that 5-15 year old cars are most likely to have their mileage rolled back.
