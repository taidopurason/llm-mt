Matthew Hill, who moved to Estonia from Australia, established an organic shoot plantation in Läänemaa with his wife Piret.
On his vegetable beds, however, the owner practices tillage without a shovel, i.e. sustainable agriculture, which is already very popular in other parts of the world: the beds are not dug, only slightly aerated.
The Hill family's innovative ideas and techniques in vegetable growing have attracted attention, so they won the title of the best organic producer this year.
