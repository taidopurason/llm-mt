The meal had already been ordered and the invitations sent: the Finns decided to cancel the presidential ball at the last moment
The Office of the President of Finland announced today that for the second year in a row, the traditional presidential ball will be canceled on Independence Day.
The decision was essentially delayed until the last moment, because the event should have taken place already on December 6
This means that many working hours have already been dedicated to organizing the ball.
Some time ago, invitations were sent out and drinks and meals were also ordered.
According to the office, nothing goes to waste, but they can already be used at the next events.
The invitations sent out on this occasion are also valid a year from now, writes Iltalehti.
"Preparations for the reception took into account the small number of guests, and therefore fewer things were stocked for the event," said a representative of the office.
The reason for the cancellation of the ball is the same as last year.
Namely, they are worried about the rise in coronavirus infections.
However, the presidential couple Sauli Niinist√∂ and Jenni Haukio have found a way to celebrate Independence Day with their people.
On December 6, the president and first lady will give an interview to Yle directly from the palace.
Several well-known musicians will also perform in the same broadcast.
