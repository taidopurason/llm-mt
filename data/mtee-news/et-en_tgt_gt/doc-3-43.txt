The food had already been ordered and the invitations were sent: Finns decided to leave the presidential ball at the last moment
The Office of the Finnish President today announced that for the second year in a row, the traditional presidential ball will be canceled on Independence Day.
The decision was essentially stretched to the last moment because the event should have been on December 6
This means that many hours of work are already dedicated to the organization of the ball.
Some time ago, invitations were sent out and drinks and meals were also ordered.
According to the office, nothing is wasted, but can be used at the next events.
The invitations sent out this time will also apply in a year, writes Iltalehti.
"Preparations for the reception took into account the number of guests and therefore fewer things were stocked for the event," the office spokesman said.
The reason for the ball cancellation is the same as last year.
Namely, they are concerned about the rise in coronavirus infections.
However, the presidential couple Sauli Niinist√∂ and Jenni Haukio have found a way to celebrate their people's Independence Day with their people.
On December 6, the President and Esileed will give an interview directly to Yle.
Several well -known musicians perform in the same transmission.
