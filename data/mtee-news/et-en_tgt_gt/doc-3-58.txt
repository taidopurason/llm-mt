Gas instead of brake.
The controversial plant got the cornerstone despite ongoing litigation
Until there is a court ruling, the factory will not be built, government members said this summer.
However, the oil plant got the cornerstone on Tuesday of last week with the approval of the ministers.
On November 16, Eesti Energia laid the cornerstone for the Enefit280 oil shale oil plant, for the construction of which the government allocated 125 million euros of taxpayers' money to the state-owned company, and the construction of which was sued by climate youth.
Those who are more observant will remember that just half a year earlier, the Tartu District Court suspended the plant's construction permit as a preliminary legal protection procedure, and Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that a clear message was sent to Eesti Energia: until the end of the litigation, the brakes on the construction of the plant must be pulled.
In November, however, Eesti Energia pressed the bottom of the gas and started construction.
Legally, Eesti Energia indeed has the right to start building the plant, because at the beginning of June, the Tartu District Court canceled the construction ban on the oil plant.
However, the company took a business risk by laying the cornerstone for the factory, because the dispute over the legality of the building permit is still ongoing.
"In the event that the factory's buildings and facilities have been erected at the end of the litigation, but the appeal is satisfied and the construction permit is declared invalid, the further course of affairs depends on the reasoning of the courts.
It is entirely possible that the buildings will turn out to be illegal, and theoretically there is a possibility that they will have to be demolished," explained KÃ¤rt Vaarmari, a lawyer at the Center for Environmental Law.
