Instead of the brake.
The controversial factory received the cornerstone despite the ongoing litigation
Before there is no judgment, the factory will not be built, the members of the government said this summer.
However, on Tuesday of last week, the oil plant got a cornerstone with the approval of ministers.
On November 16, Eesti Energia's cornerstone was awarded to the Enefit280 cornerstone of the shale oil plant, for which the government allocated to a state -owned company of 125 million euros of taxpayers' money and the climate of the construction of the construction.
More attentive remembers that just half a year earlier, the Tartu Circuit Court suspended the factory building permit and Prime Minister Kaja Kallas suspended that Eesti Energia had a clear message: the end of the litigation had to be brake.
In November, however, Eesti Energia pressed the gas and started construction.
Legally, Eesti Energia has the right to start building the factory, as in early June the Tartu Circuit Court overturned the construction ban on the oil plant.
However, the company took a business risk to the factory's cornerstone, as the dispute over the legality of the building permit is still in progress.
“If the factory buildings and facilities have been erected at the end of the litigation, but the complaint is upheld and the building permit is repealed, the further course of the affairs depends on the grounds of the courts.
It is quite possible that the buildings turn out to be illegal, and in theory there is a possibility that they need to be demolished, ”explained Kärt Vaarmari, a lawyer at the Center for Environmental Law.
