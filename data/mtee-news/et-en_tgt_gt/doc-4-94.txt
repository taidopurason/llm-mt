Migration pressure is intensified: Finnish entrepreneurs have also been complained of and threatened with tax increases
It is sad when Finns have been put to the megaphone of the Reform Party immigration plans, who complain that there is a lack of labor in Estonia, while Estonians work at the northern neighbors - they will then bring Estonians back home, to Finnish companies here.
However, the media screams every day about labor shortages, which is probably a new propaganda campaign to practice people with immigration.
This is how BNS writes: At a meeting of the Finnish-Estonian Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday, foreign companies operating in Estonia saw labor shortage as the biggest disadvantage of the Estonian economic environment.
"Estonian and Finnish companies have a common problem where there is an increasing lack of skilled labor in a country with an aging population," said Andres Sutt, Minister of Enterprise and Information Technology, who participated in the meeting in a press release.
"At the same time, we see a similar solution on both sides of the shore that recruitment of skilled skills from abroad sharing values with us is the only solution to resolve the growing skilled labor crisis in the short term," he added.
Andres Sutt could look more closely towards Finland - they solve labor problems with the help of Somalis and other "craftsmen" - and to say whether the Reform Party sees the way out.
The minister does not want to take up the topic that the story "Estonian and Finnish companies have a common problem" is also behind the Estonians emigrated during the previous reign of the squirrel.
This story is illustrated by the threat: "According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (MKM), there will be fewer people in Estonia in five years in five years and the alternative to raising the state's revenue base would be tax increases."
Perhaps it is intimidated that if strangers are not accepted, taxes will increase and there will be no pension.
"Forgot", however, that migrant workers are killing the salaries of Estonian people.
In the meantime, such threats had subsided, but only a few years ago it was written about how tens of thousands of workers were missing in construction, agriculture and elsewhere in 2040.
