Singer Jessie J lost child: I don't have control over my emotions
A well -known musician recently separated from his loved one, Max Pham, but decided to carry and raise their common child as a single mother until the end of pregnancy.
Unfortunately, during a recent review, doctors could not detect the child's heartbeat, Jessie J said in a post made by Instagram.
"Yesterday morning, I laughed with a friend, asking him," Seriously, how can I do tomorrow night in LA, without saying to the whole audience that I was pregnant? "," The singer wrote.
“For lunch, however, I fought with the idea of how I would handle it without collapsing.
During the third review of pregnancy, I was told that the baby's heart was no longer beating.
Today morning.
I have a feeling that I have no control over my emotions.
I may regret making this post later.
I don't really know. ”
Despite the fact that a woman is currently in deep grief, she has decided to do the performance in Los Angeles, believing that it will help her.
"I want to sing tonight.
Not because I avoid mourning or all the process, but because I know singing tonight will help me, "he said.
"I have only done two concerts in two years and my soul needs it.
Today more than before.
I know some people say I should cancel it, but at the moment one thing is clear to me.
I started singing when I was young because it makes me happy, fills my soul and acts as therapy.
It hasn't changed and I have to go through things in this way. "
Jessie J stated that he decided to raise the child alone because he was looking forward to becoming a mother.
She knows that life is short and pregnancy was a miracle and experience she never forget.
He hopes he will be able to become pregnant again in the future, but he is still in shock and extremely sad.
"But I know I'm strong and I know everything is fine," he added.
"I also know that millions of women around the world have felt this pain and even worse."
