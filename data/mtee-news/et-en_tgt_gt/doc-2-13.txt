Vambola SpongeBob |Let's establish a maximum price for gasoline, following the example of Hungary
A month ago, I happened to listen to the program "The Prime Minister is in the Studio" on the radio.
When the reporter asked Kaja Kallas how much a liter of fuel costs at gas stations, silence followed.
The Prime Minister hesitantly announced, he doesn't know.
At a time when energy carriers are becoming more expensive in the world, let the head of government know how much something costs!
Consequently, he has strangers and bad advisers.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, knows very well.
Hungary fixed national fuel prices for three months.
They must not be more than 500 forints or 1.42 euros per liter at gas stations.
Currently, the fixed price for three months is 480 forints or 1.37 euros per liter.
Prices are reviewed every three months.
The upper limit was prompted by accelerated inflation, and it is the highest in the country in nine years - 6.5 percent.
According to the decision, gas station chains can sell cheaper, but not more expensive.
