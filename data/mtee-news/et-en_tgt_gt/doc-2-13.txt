Vambola Paavo |Let's set up the maximum price of gasoline on Hungary
A month ago, I came across a radio show "The Prime Minister is in the Studio".
When the reporter asked Kaja Kallas how much a fuel liter at the filling stations, silence followed.
The Prime Minister announced hesitantly, I do not know.
At the time in the world, energy carriers become more expensive that the head of government is about how much something costs!
Consequently, he has strangers and bad advisers.
On the other hand, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban knows and very well.
Hungary fixed fuel prices for three months.
They must not be more than 500 forints or 1.42 euros per liter at gas stations.
Currently, a fixed price for three months is 480 forints or 1.37 euros per liter.
Prices are reviewed every three months.
The ceiling was driven by accelerated inflation and is the largest in the country in nine years - 6.5 percent.
According to the decision, gas stations may be sold cheaper, but no more expensive.
