Shop Santa's gift bag with nuts from a domestic nut producer
Candies, different bars and chocolate bars - does it seem like a normal choice to put in Santa's gift bag or elf's slipper?
In reality, they are not healthy at all.
Instead, you could make your child or loved one happy during the Christmas period with something healthy.
Various nuts, almonds and seeds are beneficial for health.
So many may frown upon saying that nuts are also high in fat - so couldn't they be equated with candy?
No, definitely not.
If you look at the label on the package of nuts, you can read that the fats in nuts consist almost entirely of healthy unsaturated fatty acids that are very necessary for the body, there are a small amount of saturated fatty acids, and there are no trans fats at all.
Fats are good for our body and should not be completely avoided.
However, it is important to prefer unsaturated fatty acids, i.e. good fats, which can be obtained from nuts, seeds and almonds.
That is why Germund Hulg, the only nut producer in Estonia, recommends choosing healthy snacks during the Christmas holidays.
Especially popular are Germund Hulgi's black Premium packages, which contain the largest nuts and dried fruits.
For example, hazelnuts come from Georgia, almonds from California, raisins and cranberries from Chile, cashews from Vietnam.
However, roasting, salting, mixing into tasty mixtures and packaging takes place in Estonia.
