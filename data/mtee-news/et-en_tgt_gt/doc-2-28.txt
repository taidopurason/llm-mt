Poet Santa's gift bag for domestic nut producer nuts
Candies, different bars and chocolate bars - seems a standard choice in Santa's gift bag or dwarf slippers?
In reality, they are not healthy at all.
Instead, a child or a beloved person could be delighted with something healthy during the Christmas season.
Different nuts, almonds and seeds are good for health.
Many can wrinkle their eyebrows, saying that there are many fats in the nuts too - would they not be equated with candy?
No, certainly not.
If you look at the label on the nut pack, you may read that nuts are almost entirely of healthy and unsaturated fatty acids for the body, a small amount of saturated fatty acids and there are no trans fats.
Fats are beneficial to our bodies and should not be completely avoided.
However, it is important to prefer unsaturated fatty acids, or good fats that can be obtained from nuts, seeds and almonds.
So the only Estonian nut producer Germund recommends choosing healthy snacks on Christmas holidays.
Germund is particularly popular with a wholesale black premium pack, which reach the largest nuts and dried fruits.
For example, the hazelnuts come from Georgia, almonds from California, raisins and cranberries from Chile, cashew nuts from Vietnam.
However, roasting, salting, mixing and packing into delicious mixtures takes place in Estonia.
