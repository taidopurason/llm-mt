A step towards sustainability: SEAT connects Spanish and Portuguese factories by rail to reduce CO2 emissions
The Spanish car manufacturer SEAT has set a goal of becoming a carbon neutral company by 2050.
To achieve this, SEAT launched the “Move to Zerø” environmental program to reduce CO2 emissions throughout the life cycle of products, services and mobility solutions.
Now, however, SEAT plans to take another step forward in its "Move to Zerø" strategy with a new rail service connecting the Martorell (Spain) plant with the Volkswagen Autoeuropa plant in Palmela (Portugal).
Until now, vehicles produced in Martorell were transported by train to Salobral (Madrid) and from there by truck to various dealerships.
With the new line, the vehicles arrive directly at the Palmela factory, from where they are transported for the last time by truck to the distribution depot in Azambuja, 75 kilometers away.
Currently, the service will operate twice a week and is expected to carry over 20,000 vehicles a year.
Thanks to this, 2,400 truck journeys are avoided per year and CO2 emissions are reduced by as much as 43%.
The new train service, operated by Pecovasa Renfe Mercancías, consists of 16 carriages.
Its maximum length is 500 meters and it can transport up to 184 vehicles per trip.
From 2023, a train with 18 cars will be put into use, which can transport nearly 200 vehicles at the same time.
By 2024, hybrid locomotives will be running on the tracks, which will allow the route to use 100% electricity.
