Step towards sustainability: Seat connects the Spanish and Portuguese factories to the train path to reduce CO2 emissions
Spanish car manufacturer Seat has set a goal to become a carbon -neutral company by 2050.
To achieve this, Seat launched an environmental program "Move to Zerø" to reduce CO2 emissions throughout the life cycle of products, services and mobility solutions.
Now, however, Seat plans to set up another step further in the "Move to Zerø" strategy with a new railway service that connects the Martorelli (Spain) factory to Volkswagen Autoeuropa factory in Palmela (Portugal).
Until now, Martorell's vehicles were transported by train to Salobral (Madrid) and transported from there to various representations by truck.
With the new line, the vehicles reach the Palmela factory directly from where they will be transported by a truck to the Azambuja distribution depot, 75 kilometers from 75 kilometers away.
Currently, the service will work twice a week and are expected to carry over 20,000 vehicles a year.
As a result, 2,400 trucks are avoided per year and CO2 emissions are reduced by as much as 43%.
The new train traffic, operated by Pecovasa Renfe Mercancías, consists of 16 wagons.
It has a maximum length of 500 meters and allows to transport up to 184 vehicles per trip.
From 2023, 18 wagons will be introduced to transport nearly 200 vehicles at a time.
By 2024, hybrid locomotives will move on the rails, allowing 100% electricity on the route.
