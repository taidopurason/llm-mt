Agricultural Chamber: The Green Turn cannot be a victim of production
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce considers that, for climate neutrality, businesses, consumers and the state need to make efforts, but at the same time the achievement of green turn goals cannot be achieved by local production and reducing the number of animals.
Changes involved in the green turn must also be economically feasible for companies, which must be made for businesses, consumers and the state together.
The Chamber of Agriculture considers it important that before making decisions, there is an understanding of the combined effect of the climate package and the EU green agreement strategies for Estonian agricultural and food production.
The real environmental impact of the Estonian agricultural sector is needed to get an overview of the basic assessment of the location and method of management.
Also, the achievement of green turn goals cannot be done by local production and reducing the number of animals.
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce supports the direction taken by the European Commission by 2050 to achieve climate-neutrality, although it will be a major challenge for our agricultural, food, forestry and rural economy sectors.
However, each challenge also involves the possibilities that need to be skilfully exploited are found in an opinion sent to the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in an opinion on the European Commission Climate Package "Objective 55", according to BNS.
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce, who was led last year by his leader Roomet Room, the initiator of the Ukrainian imports, is trying to make the eye for both green and farmers-while the desires of farmers and climate hysterics are so different that they are difficult to reconcile.
In addition to the future of farmers, all kinds of ideological associations and pressure groups, such as animal and environmentalists, vegans and others whose activities are aimed at restricting and terminating animal keeping.
