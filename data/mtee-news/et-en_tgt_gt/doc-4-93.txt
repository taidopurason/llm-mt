Chamber of Agriculture: production cannot be sacrificed for the green revolution
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce believes that both companies, consumers and the state must strive for climate neutrality, but at the same time, achieving the goals of the green revolution cannot be achieved through local production and reducing the number of animals.
The changes accompanying the green revolution must also be economically feasible for companies, for which efforts must be made by both entrepreneurs, consumers and the state together.
The Chamber of Agriculture considers it important that, before making decisions, there is an understanding of the combined effect of the climate package and the EU's Green Deal strategies on Estonian agricultural and food production.
In order to get an overview of the real environmental impact of the Estonian agricultural sector, a comprehensive assessment based on the location and management method is needed.
Also, achieving the goals of the green revolution cannot be achieved through local production and reduction of the number of animals.
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce supports the direction taken by the European Commission to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, although this will be a big challenge for our agriculture, food industry, forestry and rural economy sectors.
However, every challenge is accompanied by opportunities that must be used skillfully, according to the opinion sent by the Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce to the Ministry of the Environment regarding the European Commission's climate package "Target 55", reports BNS.
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce, which last year was the initiator of the importation of Ukrainians led by its leader Romet SÃµrmus, is trying to pay attention to both the green revolution and farmers - at the same time, the wishes of farmers and climate hysterics are so different that it is difficult to reconcile them.
In addition, the future of farmers is also haunted by all kinds of ideological associations and pressure groups, such as animal and environmentalists, vegans and others whose activities are aimed at limiting and ending animal husbandry.
