In Botswana, a new and "truly terrible" variant of coronaic was identified on B.1.1.529
In Botswana, a new variant of a coronavirus variant of as many as 32 spots has been identified on B.1.1.529 and it is not yet known whether people have existing antibodies to react effectively.
So far, only a handful of infections have been registered as a result of sequencing - three in Botswana, six in South Africa and one in Hong Kong.
Thus, scientists hope that COVID cases caused by a new virus variant are not widespread, I will write Sky News.
Tom Peacock, a virologist at London Imperial College, mentioned the abundance of mutations discovered in the variant "truly terrible":
Og proteins are the ones used by viruses to enter human cells, and the principle of most vaccines is to train and neutralize the human body.
Therefore, mutations of spawning protein may be problematic for mRNA vaccines.
Professor Francois Balloux, a professor at the University of London, said the new option should be closely monitored and analyzed.
"But there is no reason to worry, unless its incidence increases in the near future," he said.
The professor added that the abundance of mutations on B.1.1.529 may be due to the fact that it "developed immunodeficiency during a chronic human illness, perhaps untreated in HIV / AIDS patient".
The first cases of infection with this variant were found in Botswana on November 11 and three days later in South Africa.
A 36-year-old man was found in Hong Kong, who had a negative PCR test before flying from Hong Kong to South Africa, where he was from October 22 to November 11.
He gave a negative test when he returned to Hong Kong, but on November 13th the test result was already positive.
The Guardian writes that some Virologists in South Africa are already worried, especially given the recent increase in the number of cases in Gauteng, where cases have been discovered on B.1.1.529.
Treatment with the clinical microbiology professor of Cambridge University, Gupta told the publication that his laboratory found that two mutations in B.1.1.529 increased the infectancy of the virus and reduced the anti -virus recognition.
