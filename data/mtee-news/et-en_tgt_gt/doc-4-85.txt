A wrong green turn or just plain stupidity: toilets and trash cans are disappearing from the side of national roads
Another example of the bad side of austerity comes from the transport agency, which goes against the green thinking that is so widely introduced in our country.
Since the Transport Board has to cut operating costs by more than 3.5 million euros in the coming year, removing toilets and trash cans from parking lots was found as one of the savings points.
The decision was made based on the fact that by cutting these costs, road safety suffers the least, Raido Randmaa, director of the infrastructure management service of the Transport Board, explained to ERR.
There are toilets belonging to the Transport Board in 61 parking lots across Estonia, garbage containers in 63 parking lots.
The office spends 472,000 euros a year on toilets, and 267,000 euros on trash cans.
According to Randmaa, this decision has already been made in the Transport Board, but since the budget of the board has not yet been finally approved, this decision has not been signed.
"Well, come to heaven's help - as a former Circle K manager and today Ragn-Sells manager, I can't keep quiet," top manager Kai Realo comments on this decision on social media.
"When Circle K wanted to build service stations along the new highways, where, as you know, both trash cans and toilets, the greatest difficulty was to find locations where the National Road Administration at the time would have allowed normal pick-up and drop-off, because "Estonia is so small that here a person can drive all over the country at the same timefrom edge to edge and he doesn't need to refuel, eat or go to the toilet on the way".
Realo adds that such an attitude was speechless at the time, but the decision now is downright maddening: "Can you imagine this 'land of pissing men' and these piles of garbage on the edge of the forest?"
