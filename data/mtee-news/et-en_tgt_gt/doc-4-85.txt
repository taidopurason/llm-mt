Righteous green coup or just stupid cube: toilets and trash cans disappear from the state roads
Another example of a savings comes from the transport office, which is crossed by the green thinking we are so widely introduced.
As the Transport Agency has to cut operating costs over EUR 3.5 million next year, removal of toilets and trash cans from parking lots was found as one of the savings.
The decision was made on the basis of the least suffering from road safety when cutting these costs, Raido Randmaa, director of the Transport Agency Infrastructure Management Service, explained to the ERR.
There are 61 parking lots all over Estonia, 63 garbage containers in Estonia.
The Agency costs € 472,000 per year for toilets and € 267,000 for trash cans.
According to Randmaa, this decision has already been made in the transport office, but since the budget of the Agency has not yet been finally approved, this decision does not sign.
"Well, come to the rescue-I can't shut up as the leader of the former Circle K and today Ragn-Sells," comments Kai Realo, a top manager in social media.
“If Circle k wanted to build service stations along the new highways where both trash cans and toilets are known to have the greatest trouble to get locations where the then Road Administration would have given normal and outfits, because" Estonia is so small that people can drive all the timeFrom the edge to the edge and he does not need to refuel, eat or go to the toilet. ”
Realo adds that this attitude was then loud at that time, but the present decision was even frantic: "You can imagine it" the land of the glowing men "and those garbage piles on the forest water?"
