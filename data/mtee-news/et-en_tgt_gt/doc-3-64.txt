Prosecutor of the woman who died the woman's case: she regretted her act and voluntarily sought help
On Wednesday, we wrote about a case in which Kiur, who had abused a woman and caused her negligence, was sentenced to two years' imprisonment with a three -year and three -month probationary period.
This means that behind the bars, the man had to spend only two days as of now.
District Attorney Kelly Kruusim√§gi said such a punishment is justified because Kiur regretted the act and voluntarily sought help from his problems.
We publish a comment by the prosecutor.
"With the evidence gathered by pre -trial investigation, Kiur found a woman once in the face and the victim's death came about two days later.
The evidence confirms that immediately after the stroke and the next two days, the woman interacted with Kiur.
The next day, the woman left the apartment, moved around, and according to Kiuri, she did not realize that she might have a health damage that could be dangerous and need medical intervention.
When evaluating the whole event, this is vital because, as an alcohol abuser, a woman could also move with certain coordination disorders.
Also, the victim was not bloody after the stroke and did not complain about anything unusual.
Thus, we did not identify the intention of killing and the evidence did not refer to the desire to cause life -threatening health damage.
Kiur has no existing criminal penalties.
He confessed to hit the victim and regretted his act and that he did not understand the need to call an ambulance.
He voluntarily sought help from his alcohol problem and was at work.
Given all these circumstances, but above all the specific act and the man's earlier behavior, the prosecutor's office was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, which would not be enforced, unless Kiur commits a new crime during the three -year and three -month probationary period.
The probationary period is the period when a person has to prove that he or she will live in a law -abiding, which is one of the goals of the punishment.
All parties, including the mother of the victim, who also said in his testimony, agreed with such a solution, that he did not think Kiur wanted the woman's death. "
