Alo Raun: congratulations, the Cohabitation Act is supported by 55%!
55% - today, according to opinion polls, the cohabitation law has the support of an absolute majority, if you look at Estonian citizens aged 18 and older who have a position on this issue.
In other words, people who can also elect the Riigikogu and participate in the referendum.
This is clear from the aggregate results of the September and October polls conducted by Norstat and commissioned by SA Liberala Kodanik.
According to the same survey, this trend has been going on for a long time.
So when we talk about what "the people want", it is no longer correct to say as if we/they are against cohabitation law.
