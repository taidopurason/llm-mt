Alo Raun: Congratulations, the law of cohabitation supports 55%!
55%-Today, according to opinion polls, the Cohabitation Act has the support of the absolute majority when looking at 18-year-olds and older Estonian citizens who have a position on this issue.
Perhaps people who can also choose the Riigikogu and participate in a referendum.
This is how the September and October polls commissioned by Norstat and the Liberal Citizen.
According to the same survey, such a trend has been going on for a long time.
So when we talk about what the "people want", it is no longer correct to say that we/they were against the law on cohabitation.
