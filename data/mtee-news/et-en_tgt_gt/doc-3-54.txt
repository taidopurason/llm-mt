A stack of books hid a murder victim on the heath.
The case is in the hands of "cold homicide" investigators
In 2019, the police received an unusual invitation to NÃµmme Lemmiku street: during the renovation work of an old house, it was discovered that a dead body was hidden under a stack of neatly arranged books in one of the rooms.
How is this possible?
One elderly lady has been visited by investigators twice, but has not yet caught a moment clear enough to answer the question.
The lady may hold the key to one of the murders: According to one source, she once said years ago that her son might be guilty of the crime.
