In Nõmme, the book was hiding the murder victim.
The case is in the hands of 'cold murders' investigators
In 2019, police received an unusual invitation to Nõmme on Favorite Street: during the renovation of the old house, it turned out that a body hidden under a stack of booklet was stacked in one room.
How is this possible?
One of the elderly ladies has visited the village twice, but there is not yet a clear moment to answer the question.
Mrs. may have the key to one murder: she has said for years ago that her son may be guilty of a crime.
