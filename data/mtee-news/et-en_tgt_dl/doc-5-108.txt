A step towards sustainability: SEAT connects Spanish and Portuguese factories by rail to reduce CO2 emissions
SEAT, the Spanish carmaker, has set itself the goal of becoming a carbon neutral company by 2050.
To achieve this, SEAT has launched the environmental programme "Move to Zerø" to reduce CO2 emissions throughout the life cycle of products, services and mobility solutions.
Now, however, SEAT plans to take another step forward in its 'Move to Zerø' strategy with a new rail service linking its Martorell (Spain) plant with the Volkswagen Autoeuropa plant in Palmela (Portugal).
Up to now, vehicles produced in Martorell were transported by train to Salobral (Madrid) and then delivered by lorry to various dealerships.
The new line will take the vehicles directly to the Palmela plant, from where they will be transported by lorry for a final journey to the Azambuja distribution depot, 75 kilometres away.
The service will now run twice a week and is expected to transport more than 20 000 vehicles a year.
This will avoid 2,400 truck journeys a year and reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 43%.
The new train service, which will be operated by Pecovasa Renfe Mercancía, will consist of 16 wagons.
It will have a maximum length of 500 metres and will carry up to 184 vehicles per journey.
From 2023, an 18-carriage train will be introduced, capable of carrying up to 200 vehicles at a time.
By 2024, hybrid locomotives will be running on the tracks, enabling the line to run on 100% electricity.
