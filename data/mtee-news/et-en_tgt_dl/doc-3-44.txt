Setting a great example: Anett Kontaveit doesn't sit on her hands during the holidays and helps those in need
After a gruelling tournament in Mexico, the Estonian number one tennis player took some time off to rest in her home country.
But in the meantime she is helping those in need.
Anett Kontaveit isn't just resting on her hands, she's making the most of the time.
She has posted pictures on Instagram of herself as a "plant-man", growing green plants at home.
She also does charity work, raising awareness of the work of the Shelter NGO.
Anett posted pictures of the dogs on social media, saying she would help them again this year.
At a press conference on Monday, Anett Kontaveit said she was thinking of aiming to win the Grand Slam tournament.
"I've been thinking about it for a few days.
Of course, my dream is to win the Grand Slam, but the most important thing is that the goals are development-oriented.
I want to improve my game and certain elements of tennis, as well as my physique.
If this development process is positive, better results will come," he told Delfi Sport.
Kontaveit thanked the fans who stayed up late into the night in recent weeks after her matches in Mexico: "It has been very heartwarming to see how many people have cheered me on.
I've received so much positive feedback and I'm very grateful to everyone who cares about what I do.
Thank you also to the supporters and sponsors who have got me here."
After a short break, Kontaveit will start preparing for the new season in Tallinn and will fly to a warmer place to acclimatise as the Australian tournaments approach.
