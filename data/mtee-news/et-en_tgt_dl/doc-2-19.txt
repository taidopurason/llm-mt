ANU SÄÄRITS ON HONEST LIVING: Objectivity and the courage to stand up straight and not underestimate yourself or others are essential.
Anu's childhood home has taught her that no matter what, you have to manage.
"I come from a big family.
In our family, my mother looked after five children practically on her own, we couldn't make any demands.
I had to grow up quickly myself in order to realise my interests somehow."
Indeed, curiosity has been a driving force for Anu Sääritsa (49), who is familiar with sports news and broadcasts, since childhood.
"Quite early on I saw that there was something interesting going on in Tallinn!
I decided to drive all the way from Tartu, check it out and only when I got back to tell my family that I had been there," she says, recalling the determination that led her to repeatedly go further afield.
