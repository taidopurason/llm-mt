THE DISTANCE LEARNING IN TALLIN WAS POINTLESS!
Speed testing of schools gave just as good a result!
The four-week distance training of 4th-8th graders in Tallinn schools did not give the city an advantage in the fight against koruna, as the speed tests achieved the same result as in open school areas, dry figures confirm.
In Pärnu and part of Narva, distance learning also took place for a shorter period, but in Tallinn it started immediately after the school holidays and stretched to four weeks.
Researchers analysing corona now have an excellent basis for comparing Tallinn with the rest of Estonia.
For example, after future state exams, it will be possible to see whether four weeks of absence from school also means poorer results compared to the rest of the country.
But for now, the more important question is whether Tallinn's decision to shift municipal schools to long-distance learning has given the city more success in the fight against basketball.
After all, there was friction between Toompea and the sub-city due to the actions of Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
