Mihkel Raud on coronet hijinks on social media: it's like 15 minutes of fame that make it easy to get sympathy from others
"Life is what happens when you have other plans," he says. a wise man once said.
I think that man was John Lennon.

I had beautiful plans.
I was going to perform with Singer Vinger in Sindi, then take the bus back to Tallinn and the next day take part in the final of 'Estonia is looking for a superstar' - just as I had performed, travelled and participated countless times over the past dozen years.
But life got ahead of my plans.
"I'm not feeling too well, maybe we can go straight into town?" I tried to dissuade Singer Vinger's companions from yet another woodcutter.
We'd already done three of them.
The bus turned into the woods, the men were smoking outside and I could feel my fever rising by the second.
And if you now think you've stumbled on yet another COVIDi stick, you're only half right.
