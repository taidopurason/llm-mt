Chamber of Agriculture: production cannot be sacrificed to the green revolution
The Chambers of Agriculture and Commerce believes that climate neutrality must be pursued by businesses, consumers and the state, but that the greening objectives cannot be achieved by reducing local production and animal numbers.
The changes brought about by the green revolution must also be economically feasible for businesses, and this is something that businesses, consumers and governments must work together to achieve.
The Chamber of Agriculture considers it important to have a clear understanding of the combined impact of the climate package and the EU's Green Deal strategies on Estonian agriculture and food production before decisions are taken.
A holistic assessment based on location and management practices is needed in order to get an overview of the real environmental impact of the Estonian agricultural sector.
Also, the greening objectives cannot be achieved by reducing local production and animal numbers.
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce supports the European Commission's commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2050, although this will be a major challenge for our agricultural, food, forestry and rural sectors.
However, with every challenge comes opportunities that must be skilfully exploited, according to an opinion on the European Commission's 'Objective 55' climate package sent by the Chamber to the Environment Ministry, BNS reports.
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce, which last year spearheaded the import of Ukrainians under the leadership of its chairman Roomet SÃµrmus, is trying to appeal to both the green turn and farmers - but the wishes of farmers and climate hysterics are so different that it is difficult to reconcile them.
In addition, the future of farmers is also haunted by all sorts of ideological associations and pressure groups, such as animal and environmental rights activists, vegans and others whose activities are aimed at restricting and ending animal farming.
