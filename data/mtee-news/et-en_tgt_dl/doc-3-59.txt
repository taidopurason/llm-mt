Matthew Hill, who moved to Estonia from Australia, and his wife Piret started an organic plantation in Läänemaa.
On his vegetable garden, however, the farmer practises shovel-less soil cultivation, or sustainable farming, which is already very popular elsewhere in the world: no digging of the beds, just light aeration.
The Hillies' innovative ideas and techniques in vegetable gardening have attracted a lot of attention, and this year they were awarded the title of best organic producer.
