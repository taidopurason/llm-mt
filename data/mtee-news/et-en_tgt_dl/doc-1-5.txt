French fishermen block traffic on the English Channel to demand fishing rights
French fishermen will block barge traffic in three Channel ports and freight traffic in a tunnel between France and Britain on Friday to demand post-Brexit fishing rights, a union said.
Gerard Romiti, chairman of the French National Committee for Fisheries (CNPMEM), described the protest as a warning shot and said traffic would be blocked for several hours at the ports of Saint-Malo, Ouistreham and Calais, as well as the Eurotunnel.
The long-running dispute between Britain and France over fishing licences remains unresolved and threatens to escalate into a full-scale trade war.
"We don't want donations, we just want our permits back.
The UK must respect the post-Brexit deal," Romiti said.
"We have been holding our breath for 11 months.
There are limits to the patience of professionals.
We hope this warning bell will be heard," he said, without ruling out further action.
France has threatened to ban British fishing vessels from landing their catches in French ports and impose stricter controls on all British imports.
President Emmanuel Macron said such measures were being waited for to give a chance for negotiations, but French officials insist all options are still on the table.
Talks between French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune and British Brexit Minister David Frost have so far failed to bear fruit.
Under last year's deal between Britain and the European Union, European fishing vessels can continue to fish in British waters if they can prove they did so in the past.
According to Paris, requests from several dozen French vessels have been rejected without justification.
London denies this.
