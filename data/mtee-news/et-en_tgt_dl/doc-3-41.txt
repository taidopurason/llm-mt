Government makes an exception: more spectators allowed for Estonia-Israel selection game
The government has decided to allow up to 3,360 spectators for the men's basketball World Cup qualifying match between the Estonian and Israeli national teams, which will take place this Sunday in Tallinn's Saku Great Hall, as an event of overriding public interest.
Under the current restrictions, a maximum of 1,000 spectators will be allowed to attend the indoor matches from 15 November.
The health authority will support the event with an increased number of spectators if the organiser mitigates the risk of the spread of the coronavirus in accordance with the submitted plan, the government said on its website.
The spectators would be divided into four zones in the Saku Suurhalle and would not come into contact with each other, the players or the staff serving the game.
Access to the event would be subject to the presentation of a COVID certificate and on-site mask checks.
In the sectors, it has been taken into account that people will be dispersed and that each area will have its own ventilation.
The use of trombones and the like is prohibited.
The Estonian Basketball Federation is advising spectators to arrive in good time to avoid queues at the entrance to check certificates and documents.
Doors will be opened one hour before the start of the event.
In total, 14 different entrances will be open on the four levels.
Estonia will kick off the 2023 World Cup selection series on Thursday evening when they face Germany in Nuremberg.
Tickets for Sunday's game against Israel can be purchased from Piletitasche.
