Readers' magazine | Appikarje: the shopping trolley only had wobbly legs sticking out of it
A man rescued a child who had fallen into the shopping trolley in a shop.
Does a child even belong in a shopping trolley?!
"I was on my weekly shopping trip and was just about to turn in between the fridges when I saw two legs sticking out.
At first I didn't understand what was going on, but then I realised there was a baby in the trolley.
I can't say for sure, but it was probably a toddler trying to climb out of the food trolley feet first.
Or maybe he had squeezed awkwardly in between the goods and was sitting upright," says Siim, describing the scene in the shop.
