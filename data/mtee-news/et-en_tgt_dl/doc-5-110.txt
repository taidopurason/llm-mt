European Medicines Agency green light: Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine is suitable for children aged 5-11 years
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Thursday recommended extending the marketing authorisation for the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine Comirnaty to children aged 5-11 years.
Until now, the vaccine was authorised for 12 years and older.
The dose of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine for children aged 5-11 years is three times lower than the usual dose (10 µg compared to 30 µg).
As for the older age group, the vaccine course is given to children in two injections three weeks apart.
A clinical study of 2,000 children showed that 5-11 year olds had the same immune response with three times the dose as the older age group with the full dose.
Side effects were similar to those in the older age group and were mild to moderate, resolving within days.
Therefore, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) concluded that the benefits of the vaccine in children aged 5-11 years outweigh the risks.
The Agency will now send a recommendation to the European Commission, which will take a final decision on the use of the vaccine.
Marje Oona, a member of the National Expert Committee on Immunoprophylaxis, told ERR that the Commission is expected to take a decision on the matter next week.
"Since the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval is in place, we know that the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval has been in place for some time.
The US Immunisation Committee has already made this recommendation quite some time ago and more than three million children have already been vaccinated in the US, so I don't really see any reason why it should not be given.
But we haven't discussed it yet," commented Dr Oona.
