Gas instead of brake.
Controversial factory gets cornerstone despite ongoing litigation
The plant will not be built until there is a court ruling, government officials said this summer.
Yet the oil refinery got the go-ahead from ministers last Tuesday.
On 16 November, Eesti Energia laid the foundation stone for the Enefit280 oil shale oil plant, which the government allocated €125 million of taxpayers' money to the state-owned company to build and which climate activists sued to stop.
Those who pay attention will remember that only six months earlier, the Tartu District Court suspended the construction permit for the plant under a preliminary injunction, and Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that a clear message had been sent to Eesti Energia: the construction of the plant must be put on hold until the end of the legal dispute.
In November, however, Eesti Energia pushed the gas pedal to the floor and started construction.
Legally, Eesti Energia does have the right to start building the plant, because in early June the Tartu District Court lifted the construction ban on the oil plant.
However, the company took a commercial risk by laying the foundation stone for the plant, as the dispute over the legality of the building permit is still pending.
"In the event that the plant's buildings and facilities are finally erected at the end of the dispute, but the appeal is upheld and the building permit is declared invalid, the further course of the case will depend on the reasoning of the courts.
It is entirely possible that the buildings will turn out to be illegal, and theoretically there is a possibility that they will have to be demolished," explained Kärt Vaarmari, a lawyer at the Environmental Law Centre.
