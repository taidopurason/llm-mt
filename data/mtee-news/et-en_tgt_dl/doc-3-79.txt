GP warning: flu is on the move!
This is a serious illness, it's not just a runny nose and a cough.
How can you protect yourself?
There's a lot of talk about the coronavirus, its prevention and treatment.
People tend to forget that there are a lot of different respiratory viruses circulating in the autumn-winter season and that the flu has already arrived in Estonia, so it's high time to protect yourself from the virus, says Triinu-Mari Ots, Head of the Laagri Family Medical Centre and family doctor, giving advice on how to recognise and prevent the flu.
The typical Estonian autumn-winter season of coughs, colds and sore throats has begun, with acute upper respiratory viral infections caused by various viruses being the most common.
"The most common causes are rhinovirus, RS virus, adenovirus and parainfluenza.
The common name for these diseases is acute respiratory viral infections and they are treated for a specific symptom, be it a cough, sore throat, runny nose or headache," says Triinu-Mari Ots.
An exception is the flu virus, which has a very specific course and can be identified by symptoms in the first days of illness.
"In this case, tests will also be taken to provide laboratory confirmation of the presence of the flu virus," says the GP.
This is important both for prescribing treatment and for preventing or limiting outbreaks, for example at work, in the gym or at school.
