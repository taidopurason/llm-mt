Mart Seim: I'm the only one of the super-heavy lifters who competed at the Rio Olympics who hasn't been caught with banned substances
Estonia's most successful lifter Mart Seim and his counterpart Leho Pent are preparing for the World Championships, which start in two weeks.
If their favourite sport remains on the Olympic programme, both want to compete until at least the 2024 Paris Games.
This summer's Tokyo Olympic aspirations were hampered by a coronavirus suffered in the spring, which left both Mart and Leho confined to their beds and unable to regain their athletic form for the European Championships.
