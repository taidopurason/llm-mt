HINA MEDITATION RECOMMENDS: this plant should now be in every home!
In the autumn, when it's crisp and damp outside, you need to strengthen and warm your body.
A number of herbs are perfect for this, keeping the heat in but not letting it build up.
It's very handy to put both herbs and hot water in a thermos, take it to work or school and drink a tea to support the body throughout the day, suggests the Health Alchemy blog.
When you run out of tea, you can add boiling water to the plants several times.
