Poach nuts from a local nut producer for Santa's gift bag
Candies, various batonni√®res and chocolate bars - seem like the usual choice for Santa's gift bag or Santa's sushi?
In reality, they're not healthy at all.
Instead, you could treat your child or loved one to something healthy at Christmas time.
A variety of nuts, almonds and seeds are good for your health.
Some may raise an eyebrow, saying that nuts are also high in fats - could they not be equated with sweets?
No, certainly not.
If you look at the label on a packet of nuts, you will read that the fats in nuts are almost entirely made up of healthy unsaturated fatty acids, which are essential for the body, with a small amount of saturated fatty acids and no trans fats.
Fats are good for our bodies and should not be avoided completely.
However, it is important to choose unsaturated fats, the good fats, which are found in nuts, seeds and almonds.
That's why Germund Hulgi, the only Estonian nut producer, recommends choosing healthy snacks at Christmas.
Germund Hulgi's black-coloured Premium packs are particularly popular, packed with the biggest nuts and dried fruit.
For example, hazelnuts from Georgia, almonds from California, raisins and cranberries from Chile, and Indian nuts from Vietnam.
Roasting, salting, blending into tasty mixtures and packaging, however, is done in Estonia.
