"You can't say I'm not a woman."

With naturally high testosterone, Namibian sprinters Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi don't fit into the usual boundaries and keep raising new questions.
During the Tokyo Olympics, Estonians were able to cheer on Maicel Uibo's wife Shaunae Miller-Uibo as she successfully defended her 400m title.
It was an overwhelming victory, but to be fair, all the potential challengers fell away for one reason or another and the slender Bahamian had to win.
In short, the path to the gold medal was cleared with a broom.
The Bahraini quarter-miler Salwa Eid Naser, who surprisingly took first place ahead of Miller-Uibo at the World Championships in Doha two years earlier, was penalised for failing to provide doping samples.
A new super-talented American-born 19-year-old Athing Mu opted for the 800 m, where he became Olympic champion.
And the Namibian teenage sprinters who have shown very fast times this year (Christine Mboma ran 48.54 and Beatrice Masilingi 49.53) were banned by the World Athletics Association (WA) from the 400 m due to high testosterone levels.
But what will happen to them now?
Mboma and Masilingi, who finished second and sixth respectively in the 200m in Tokyo, are still causing controversy.
Nobody seems happy.
Some think they have been discriminated against, others believe the duo should not be competing in the women's event at all.
The issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible, as observers say it is only a matter of time before Mboma, with her very poor start but unprecedented finishing speed, sets world records.
