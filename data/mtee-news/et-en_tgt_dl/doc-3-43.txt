Dinner had already been ordered and invitations sent: the Finns decided to cancel the Presidential Ball at the last minute
The Finnish President's Office announced today that for the second year in a row, the traditional President's Ball will be cancelled on Independence Day.
The decision has been delayed until the last minute, as the event should have taken place on 6 December.
This means that many hours have already been devoted to organising the ball.
Invitations were sent out some time ago, and drinks and meals were ordered.
According to the registry, nothing is wasted and can be used for future events.
The invitations sent out this time will also be valid a year later, writes Iltalehti.
"Preparations for the reception took into account the low number of guests and therefore fewer items were stocked for the event," said a representative of the Chancellery.
The reason for the cancellation is the same as last year.
There are concerns about the rise in coronavirus infections.
However, Presidential couple Sauli Niinist√∂ and Jenni Haukio have found a way to celebrate Independence Day with their people.
On 6 December, the President and the First Lady will give an interview to Yle live from the palace.
The same broadcast will also feature performances by several well-known musicians.
