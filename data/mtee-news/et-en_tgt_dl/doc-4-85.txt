A mad dash for green or just a fool in a cube: toilets and bins disappear from the side of national roads
Yet another example of the mischief of austerity comes from the Department for Transport, which goes against the grain of the green thinking we are so widely adopting.
With the transport authority facing a cut of more than €3.5 million in operating costs in the coming year, one of the savings identified was the removal of toilets and bins from car parks.
The decision was made on the basis that by cutting these costs, road safety would suffer the least, Raido Randmaa, director of the transport authority's infrastructure management service, told ERR.
There are toilets belonging to the transport authority in 61 car parks across Estonia, and litter bins in 63 car parks.
Toilets cost the agency €472 000 a year, and rubbish bins €267 000.
According to Mr Randmaa, the decision has already been taken by the Transport Agency, but as the Agency's budget has not yet been finalised, the decision has not been signed.
"Well, heaven help me - as a former Circle K manager and today the manager of Ragn-Sells, I can't keep quiet," comments Kai Realo, a senior manager, on social media.
"When Circle K wanted to build service stations along new roads, where, as we all know, there are garbage bins and toilets, the biggest difficulty was to find locations where the Road Administration at the time would have given normal on- and off-roads, because 'Estonia is so small that a person can drive all over the country at once from edge to edge and not need to refuel, eat or go to the toilet on the way'."
Realo adds that such an attitude was forbidden at the time, but now the decision is downright insane: "Can you imagine this 'land of pissing men' and these garbage heaps in the forest?"
