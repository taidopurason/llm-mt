Three very good Sony TVs now available at a great price with the "Black Sale".
Sony TVs aren't just for watching TV - with a host of extra apps, you can use them for all kinds of entertainment, from YouTube and Netflix to dedicated sports, games and even social media, thanks to the Google TV operating system.
Now, with the 'Black Sale', some very good screens are available at even better prices.
Discounts of up to a thousand euros.
Here are three decent deals, and you're sure to find one to suit your needs.
You can see all the 'Black Sale' deals on Sony Center's promotions page.
Both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos make this a great TV for cinema nights.
Both the sound and picture are close to cinema quality, and the 4K resolution and HDR offer good contrast.
However, 4K X-Reality PRO is a must if you're watching TV shows or videos that aren't up to 4K quality.
Sony's image enhancement technology adjusts the picture quality to be as close as possible to 4K.
With support for Apple AirPlay, Apple Homekit and Chromecast, you can connect other home devices to your smart TV without wires, streaming content over the network.
This model is currently available at a discount of â‚¬150, or 19% off.
