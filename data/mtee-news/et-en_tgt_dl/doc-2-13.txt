Vambola Paavo | Let's follow Hungary's example and set a maximum price for petrol
A month ago, I was listening to a radio programme called "Prime Minister in the studio".
When the reporter asked Kaja Kallas how much a litre of fuel costs at petrol stations, silence followed.
The Prime Minister said, diffidently, I don't know.
At a time when the world's energy prices are going up, the head of government did not know how much anything costs!
Apparently he has life-suckers and bad advisers.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, on the other hand, knows, and knows very well.
Hungary fixed fuel prices nationally for three months.
They must not be more than 500 forints, or EUR 1.42 per litre, at petrol stations.
Currently, the fixed price for three months is 480 forints, or EUR 1.37 per litre.
Prices are reviewed every three months.
The cap was prompted by accelerating inflation and is the highest in the country in nine years at 6.5 percent.
Under the decision, petrol stations can sell cheaper, but not more.
