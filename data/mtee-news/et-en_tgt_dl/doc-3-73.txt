Ülo Kalm: The elections promised a powerful new hospital.
The money comes from Brussels, but where will the staff and equipment come from?
How will the mayor, whose father is Ülo and mother is Liidia, manage to run a multi-ethnic city?
What was sad was former mayor Savisaar's belief that trust is eternal, and he put himself forward as a candidate again.
The star had gone out.
That trust is already proving to be more important than language and ethnicity is shown by the election results in Narva.
Doctors have to fight for trust against guttersnipe doctors who offer opinions instead of facts.
In addition, gentlemen who do not trust our hospital system at all have appeared in the limelight (or rather in the newspaper columns).
I have just read a Linseatic gentleman's tale of survival at PERH.
