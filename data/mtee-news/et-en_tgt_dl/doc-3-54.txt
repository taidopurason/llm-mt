In Nõmmel, a book pear hid a murder victim.
The case is in the hands of "cold case" investigators
In 2019, police received an unusual call to Lemmiku Street in Nõmme: during renovation work on an old house, it turned out that there was a dead body hidden under a neatly stacked book light bulb in one of the rooms.
How is this possible?
An elderly lady has been visited twice by investigators, but they have not yet caught a clear enough moment to answer the question.
The lady may hold the key to one of the murders: she once said, according to a source, years ago that her son may have been guilty of the crime.
