A step backwards for the green transition or just downright stupid: roadside restrooms and rubbish bins are to be removed
The Estonian Transport Administration shows us another example of the dark side of austerity as they go against the heavily promoted principles of eco consciousness.
Since the Transport Administration is required to cut operating costs by 3.5 million euros next year, one of the proposed measures is to remove restrooms and rubbish bins from car parks.
In an interview with Estonian Public Broadcasting, director of the Infrastructure Administration Division Raido Randmaa explained the decision as having the least impact on road safety.
The Transport Administration manages restrooms in 61 car parks and rubbish bins in 63 car parks all over Estonia.
The annual operating costs of restrooms amount to 472,000 euros and 267,000 euros for rubbish bins.
According to Randmaa, the decision has already been agreed upon at the Transport Administration, but it's still not official as the Transport Administration's budget has yet to be approved.
"God help us â€“ as the former director of Circle K and current director of Ragn-Sells, I cannot keep quiet about this," CEO Kai Realo wrote on social media.
"The biggest challenge Circle K faced in building new roadside stations that naturally included rubbish bins and restrooms was acquiring sites where the Transport Administration would allow decent entry and exit ramps since, in their words, 'Estonia is so small that people can drive from one end to the other without stopping for fuel, food or restrooms'."
Realo noted that the attitudes back then were enough to leave her speechless, but the decision now is downright sensless. "Can you even imagine this promised land of peeing men and forestside garbage piles?"
