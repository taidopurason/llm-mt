A go-ahead from the European Medicines Agency: Pfizer's Covid vaccine is safe for children aged 5 to 11
The European Medicines Agency announced on Thursday that the vaccination of children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine Comirnaty is now authorised.
Until now, this vaccine was only allowed for children over the age of 12.
The dosage of the Pfizer Covid vaccine meant for children aged 5 to 11 is three times smaller than the regular amount (10 µg instead of 30 µg).
The children's vaccination procedure is similar to the regular one, with two shots administered and a three-week interval in between.
The results of a clinical study of 2000 children showed that children aged 5 to 11 developed the same immunity as older age groups with a dose three times smaller.
The side effects included the same as experienced by older age groups but of a lesser or medium strength, and receded in only a few days.
This is why the European Medicines Agency has reached the conclusion that the benefits of administering children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the vaccine overshadow the risks.
The Agency will forward its recommendation to the European Commission, which will have the final say on whether to authorise the vaccine.
Marje Oone, a member of the state immunoprophylaxis expert committee, told Estonian Public Broadcasting that the Commission is likely to make a decision sometime next week.
"The European Medicines Agency has now given its approval, and we know that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also gave approval some time ago.
Considering the United States' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices gave its permission some time ago and there are already over three million children vaccinated, I don't see why the authorisation shouldn't be granted.
But the matter has not been discussed yet," Dr Oona said.
