General physician warns: the flu is on the move!
It is a severe illness, not just a cough and a runny nose.
How can you protect yourself?
People talk a lot about the coronavirus, how to prevent it and how it is treated.
According to Triinu-Mari Ots, director and physican at Laagri Perearstikeskus, this might cause people to forget that there are many respiratory viruses moving about during autumn and winter and that the flu has already made its way to Estonia, so this is the last chance to protect yourself.
The typical Estonian cough, runny nose and sore throat season of autumn and winter has begun, during which there are many viruses moving about that can cause extreme respiratory infections.
According to Triinu-Mari, "The most common ones are rhinovirus, RS-virus, adenovirus and the paraflu.
These altogether are called extreme respiratory virus infections and a specific symptom is treated, be it a cough, sore throat, a runny nose or a headache."
The flu is an exception, as it has a very specific course which is possible to identify during the first days of infection.
"In this case, tests are also taken to have a laboratory confirmation of the presence of flu," said the doctor.
This is important in order to choose the right treatment and to prevent or limit outbreaks at work, in a gym or at school.
