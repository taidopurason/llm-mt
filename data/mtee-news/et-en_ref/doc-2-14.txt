CHINESE MEDICINE RECOMMENDATIONS: Every home should have this herb!
In late autumn, when it is cold and damp outside, it's important to strengthen and warm up the body.
Many herbs that keep you warm without causing excess heat to build up are suitable for this.
The Tervise Alkeemia blog recommends a convenient method of putting herbs and hot water in a thermos, taking it to work or school and drinking it during the day to support your body.
When the tea runs out, hot water can be poured onto the herbs again.
