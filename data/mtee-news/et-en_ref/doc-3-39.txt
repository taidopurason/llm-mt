“You cannot say that I am not a woman.”
An extraordinary sprinter who ran 100 meters within 9.86 seconds
With naturally high testosterone levels, Namibia's sprinters, Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi, do not fit within the norm and raise questions.
During the Tokyo Olympics, Estonians could cheer for Maicel Uibo's wife, Shaunae Miller-Uibo, when she defended her 400-meter run title.
The victory was staggering, but in all honesty, the potential challengers all dropped out for one reason or another, so the lean Bahamian had to win.
Figuratively speaking, the way to the gold medal was paved for her.
In the Doha World Cup two years earlier, Salwa Eid Naser, a Bahraini quarterback who surprisingly took first place from Miller-Uibo, was punished for failing to take doping tests.
American born and raised Athing Mu, a 19-year-old new super talent, chose the 800-m run in which she became the Olympic winner.
And the Namibian sprinters (Christine Mboma with the time of 48.54 and Beatrice Masiling with the time of 49.53) were banned by the World Athletics Association (WA) from participating in the 400-meter run due to high testosterone levels.
But what will happen to them?
Mboma ja Masilingi, having placed second and sixth respectively in the 200-meter run in Tokyo, are still a topic of discussion.
No one seems to be content.
Some think they were discriminated against and some believe that the duo should not be allowed to participate in the womens' division.
The issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible, with the observers saying that it is only a matter of time before Mboma's going to set world records with her bad start but unprecedented speed.
