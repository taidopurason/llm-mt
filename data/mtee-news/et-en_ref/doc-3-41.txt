The government made an exception: more spectators will be allowed for the Estonian-Israeli qualifiers
This Sunday, the government considered the Estonian-Israel men's basketball World Cup qualifiers to be events of overriding public interest and will allow up to 3360 spectators for the games.
According to current restrictions, from 15 November up to 1000 spectators will be allowed to take part in indoor sports competitions.
The government announced on its website that the Health Board will support events with more participants if the organiser follows the given plan to help mitigate the risk of spreading the virus.
The spectators in Saku Suurhall will be divided into four zones and will not come into contact with each other, the players or the staff.
People still need to have a COVID certificate to enter the event and masks will be checked on-site.
The zones will take into account the dispersal of people and each area has separate ventilation.
The use of trumpets and the like is prohibited.
The Estonian Basketball Association will give advance notice for spectators to arrive at the game in time and avoid queues at the entrance with checking certifications and documents.
The doors will open an hour before the start of the event.
A total of 14 different entrances are open for the four zones.
The Estonian national team will start the 2023 World Cup qualifiers on Thursday evening, facing Germany in Nuremberg.
Tickets for Sunday's game with Israel can be purchased from Piletitasku.
