Matthew Hill, having moved from Australia to Estonia, started an organic sod farm in Lääne County with his wife Piret.
On his vegetable beds, the owner prefers to cultivate without a shovel, i.e. he practices sustainable agriculture, which is already popular in the rest of the world: the beds are not dug, only lightly aerated.
The Hill family's fresh ideas and practices in agriculture have garnered a lot of attention and won them this year's best organic farm title.
