A murder victim hidden under a stack of books in Nõmme.
This is now a cold case
In 2019, the police got a peculiar call to come to Lemmik Street in Nõmme: while renovating an old house, a skeleton was found in a room hidden under a neat stack of books.
How is this possible?
An elderly lady has been visited by the detectives twice, but the perfect moment for asking questions has not come up yet.
This woman might hold answers to a murder: according to one source, years ago, she said her son might be responsible for it.
