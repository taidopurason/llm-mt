A step towards a more sustainable future: SEAT connects factories in Spain and Portugal with a rail line to reduce CO2 emissions
The Spanish car manufacturer SEAT has made it its goal to become carbon neutral by the year 2050.
To achieve this, SEAT has launched an environmental programme “Move to Zerø” to reduce CO2 emissions across its product, service and logistics lifecycles.
In the latest step of its “Move to Zerø” strategy, SEAT is planning a railway connection between the factory in Martorell (Spain) and the Volkswagen Autoeuropa factory in Palmelas (Portugal).
Until now, vehicles manufactured in Martorell have been transported to Salobral (Madrid) by train and then to various dealerships by trucks.
The new railway allows the vehicles to be transported directly to the Palmela factory from where they will be transported by truck for the final time to the Azambuja distribution station 75 kilometres away.
The new service will start operating twice a week with the estimated yearly total of transporting 20,000 vehicles.
This will cut the annual truck deliveries by 2400 and reduce CO2 emissions by a whopping 43%.
The new railway transit system run by Pecovasa Renfe Mercancías will operate with 16 wagons.
Its maximum length will be 500 metres and will allow for up to 184 vehicles to be carried at once.
In 2023, an 18-wagon train will begin operating that will be able to handle up to 200 vehicles at once.
The year 2024 will see a hybrid locomotive start operating on the rail track, allowing for 100% electric transportation.
