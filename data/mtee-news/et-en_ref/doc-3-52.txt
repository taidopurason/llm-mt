About the tragic fate of Johannes Vares: suicide or murder?
Did Johannes Vares shoot himself to get ahead of death?
Or was he forced or intimidated into killing himself?
Or was he killed because he protested mentally not physically...
Peeter Olesk ponders in his latest work on the life and death of Vares-Barbarus.
In the early morning, when Johannes Vares, pseudonym Johannes Barbarus, (12 January 1890-29 November 1946) was found dead on the floor of his bathroom in his Kadriorg apartment, he had not been shaving his beard with a pocketknife but a real shaving blade, a lotion and a foam brush.
It should not have been hard or painful for he most likely shaved every day, but he of course had many different solutions near his mirror for treating bloody cuts.
The question is whether he wrote his suicide letters before getting infront of the mirror or after, when he had already shaved.
The answer to this would help us clarify what time Johannes Vares woke up that day, how much time he had to write his notes and where he wrote them.
A writing desk, white paper, ink and a quill are not commonplace in bathrooms!
Writing two long and personal letters takes about an hour.
Shaving, brushing teeth and gargling could have taken him a few minutes, but what Johannes Vares could not have known was the time it would have taken people to start searching for him and who would have found him first.
Taking this into consideration, I think the suicide notes were written long before his death, at least the night before.
This means that they were written with clear intent.
According to the verbal notice from Nigol Andresen, Johannes Vares did not want to live the rest of his life disabled.
From this we can deduce that he knew about the state of his illness.
The word “disabled” does not only stand for something externally noticeable, it can also mean not being able to work or taking a sick leave from work.
