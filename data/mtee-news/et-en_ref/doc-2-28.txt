Slip some local nuts into Santa's giftbag
Sweets, candies and chocolate bars – sounds like the usual choice for Santa's giftbag or Christmas stockings.
In reality, these choices are unhealthy.
Instead, make your child or loved one happy with something healthy.
Various nuts, almonds and seeds are good for you.
Many would probably make a face and point out that nuts are high in fats – would that not make them as unhealthy as sweets?
No, definitely not.
When looking at the nutritional label of a bag of nuts, you can see that that fat is almost entirely made up of healthy and necessary unsaturated fats, with only a small amount of saturated fats and no trans fats whatsoever.
Fats are important for our health and should never be completely cut out.
It is important to look for unsaturated fats, or healthy fats, that are present in nuts, seeds and almonds.
Hence, the only Estonian nut company, Germund Hulgi, recommends choosing healthy snacks during Christmas.
Especially popular are the Germund Hulgi black premium packs, which have the largest nuts and dried fruits.
The hazelnuts originate from Georgia, almonds originate from California, raisins and cranberries come from Chile and cashews are from Vietnam.
Still, the roasting, salting, mixing and packaging happens in Estonia.
