Mihkel Raud on COVID posting on social media: it's like 15 minutes of fame that make it easy to beg for sympathy
As a wise man once said, "Life is what happens when you're making other plans."
I think that man was John Lennon.
But we have a tendency to attribute brilliant quotes to the people we like the most so it is possible these wise words were said by somebdoy else.
But this has close to no effect on the quote's point.
I had nice plans.
I was supposed to perform with Singer Vinger in Sindi then take a bus to Tallinn where I would participate in "Eesti otsib superstaari" the following day - exactly how I had performed, rode and participated numerous times in a dozen years.
But life had other plans.
I tried to convince the other members of Singer Vinger not to take another stop saying "I don't feel so good, can we just go straight to the city?"
We had already made three stops.
The bus took a turn into the woods, they had another smoke break and I felt my fever rising with every second.
And if you're now thinking that you've stumbled onto another COVID-story, you're only half right.
