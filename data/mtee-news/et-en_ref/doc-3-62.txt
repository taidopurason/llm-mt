German scientists are teaching cattle to use the toilet.
The results could change the world

They are using a small area covered in fake grass with a fence around it as a toilet.
But why is this sort of training necessary?
About 10% of human greenhouse gas emissions in the world is caused by cattle.
German scientists are trying to make raising cattle more environmentally friendly with a solution that sounds impossible.
