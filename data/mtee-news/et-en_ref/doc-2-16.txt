DISTANCE LEARNING IN TALLINN WAS USELESS!
Using rapid testing in schools had the same effect.
Figures confirm that the four-week distance learning period for grades 4-8 in Tallinn did not give the city an advantage in repelling the virus, because the rapid tests achieved the same result in areas with in-person learning.
Distance learning was also used for a short period in Pärnu and partially in Narva, but in Tallinn it started immediately after the school holidays and lasted for four weeks.
Researchers analysing the virus now have an excellent comparison case with Tallinn versus the rest of Estonia.
After the next state exams, for example, they can look at whether these four weeks of absence yield worse results compared to the rest of the country.
However, the most important question now is whether Tallinn's decision to have its schools use long-distance learning resulted in the city having greater success in its fight against COVID-19.
After all, there was friction between Toompea and the Lower Town due to the activities of Mayor Mikhail Kõlvart.
