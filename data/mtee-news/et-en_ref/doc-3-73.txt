Ülo Kalm: a great hospital was promised during the election.
The money will come from Brussels, but where will the employees and equipment come from?
How will the mayor, whose father is Ülo and mother Liidia, succeed in managing a multinational city?
What's both sad and funny is the former mayor Savisaar's belief that trust is eternal, which resulted in him submitting himself as an ambassador candidate once again.

Election results in Narva are proof that trust is already more important than language and nationality.
Doctors have to fight for trust against witch doctors who offer opinions instead of facts.
In addition, gentlemen who have absolutely no trust in our hospital system have appeared in the spotlight (specifically in the newspaper).
I just read a city gentleman's confession about what he went through in the North Estonia Medical Centre.
