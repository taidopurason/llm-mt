Mart Seim: I am the only powerlifter in the Rio Olympics who has not been caught with illegal substances
Estonia's most successful powerlifter, Mart Seim, and his colleague Leho Pent are preparing for the World Cup starting in two weeks.
They both want to at least make it to the 2024 Paris Olympics, if their sport continues to be on the programme.
They could not participate in this summer's Tokyo Olympics, as both men had COVID-19 in the spring that put them in less than ideal conditions for the games.
