The Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce: we cannot let production fall victim to the green transition
The Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce recognises entrepreneurs, consumers and the government all need to work together to reach climate neutrality, however achieving the goals of the green transition cannot be attained by reducing local production and livestock numbers.
Entrepreneurs, consumers and the government must work together to ensure that the changes brought on by the green transition are economically feasible for enterprises.
It is of great importance to the Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce that, before any decisions are made, there is a clear understanding of the dual effect that the climate package and European Green Deal would have on Estonian agriculture and food production.
A comprehensive evaluation must be conducted based on location and management approach to get an accurate overview of the true impact of the Estonian agricultural sector on the environment.
The goals of the green transition cannot be achieved through reducing local production and livestock numbers.
The Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce supports the path chosen by the European Commission to achieve climate neutrality by the year 2050, though they admit it will be a great challenge for the Estonian agricultural, food, forestry and rural economy sectors.
BNS reports that a letter sent to the Estonian Ministry of Environment describing the stance the Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce has taken regarding the climate package "Fit for 55" states that with every challenge comes its own set of opportunities that need to be utilised carefully.
The Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce headed by Roomet SÃµrmus was leading the initiative to bring Ukrainian workers to Estonia last year, while still trying to appease both the green transition as well as farmers whose wants are notoriously hard to align.
Farmers are also encircled by all kinds of ideological and pressure groups such as animal rights and environmental activists, vegans and others whose activities aim to restrict or end livestock farming.
