The food had been ordered and the invitations sent, but the Finns decided to cancel the presidential ball at the last minute
The Office of the President of Finland announced today that the presidential ball would not be held on Independence Day for the second year in a row.
The decision was delayed until the last moment with the event being set for 6 December.
That means that a lot of work had already been put into organising the ball.
Invitations were sent out some time ago and drinks and meals were also ordered.
According to the office, nothing will be going to waste because it can all be used for future events.
The invitations sent out this time will also be valid next year, writes Iltalehti.
"Preparations took into account a small number of guests, so less things were gathered," said a spokesman for the office.
The reason for cancelling the ball is the same as last year.
Namely, there is concern about the increase in COVID infections.
The presidential couple Sauli Niinist√∂ and Jenni Haukio have still found a way to celebrate Independence Day with the nation.
On 6 December the president and the head lady will give an interview live from the palace for Yle.
Several well-known musicians will also perform on the broadcast.
