Sony televisions are meant not only for watching TV channels but for all kinds of entertainment. The Google TV operating system allows you to enjoy everything from Youtube and Netflix to sports broadcasts, games and social media.
During Black Friday, you can take advantage of the great deals and purchase an even better television for yourself.
Discounts can reach up to 1000 euros.
You are sure to find one that suits you among these three offers.
You can find other Black Friday deals on televisions on the Sony Center website.
Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos are both ideal for cinematic movie nights.
The sound and picture quality are both near cinema grade, and the 4K resolution and HDR technology provide a highly contrasted image.
The 4K X-Reality PRO, however, comes in handy if you're watching below 4K quality TV shows or videos.
Sony's image enhancing technologies upscale the quality of the image to be as close to 4K as possible.
You can also connect the television to other home gadgets to stream content through Apple AirPlay, Apple Homekit or Chromecast.
At the moment, this model is available at a discount of 150 euros or 19%.
