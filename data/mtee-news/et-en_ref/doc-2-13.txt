Vambola Paavo | Let's set a maximum price for petrol following Hungary's example
A month ago I happened to listen to a radio show called “Stuudios on peaminister” (Prime Minister in the Studio).
When the reporter asked Kaja Kallas how much a litre of fuel costs at gas stations, silence followed.
The Prime Minister hesitantly said that she did not know.
At a time when energy is becoming more and more expensive, the head of government does not know how much something costs!
Therefore, her advisors are ignorant and bad at their jobs.
In contrast, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, is very much aware of these things.
Hungary set limits for its fuel prices nation-wide for three months.
They may not exceed 500 forints, or 1.42 euros, per liter at petrol stations.
Currently, the fixed price for three months is set at 480 forints, or 1.37 euros, per liter.
Prices will be checked every three months.
This limit was prompted by accelerating inflation, which is the highest it has been in nine years - 6.5 percent.
According to this decision, chains can charge less for petrol, but not more than the limit.
