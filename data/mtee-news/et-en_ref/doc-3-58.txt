Gas over brakes.
A controversial factory got its cornerstone despite the ongoing court debate
This summer, members of the government said that without an official court ruling the plant cannot be built.
Despite this, last week on Thursday the oil plant got its cornerstone with the approval of ministers.
On 16 November, Eesti Energia laid the cornerstone for the oil plant Enefit280, for the construction of which the government allocated 125 million euros of taxpayers' money to the state-owned company. The construction was sued by young climate activists.
The more observant will remember that just half a year ago, the Tartu District Court suspended the construction permit of the plant under preliminary legal protection and Prime Minister Kaja Kallas sent a clear message to Eesti Energia: they have to pull the brakes on construction of the plant until the debate is cleared.
But in November, Eesti Energia stepped on the gas instead and began construction.
Legally, Eesti Energia has the right to start building the plant, because at the beginning of June, the construction ban on the oil plant was overturned by the Tartu District Court.
The company still took a risk by laying the cornerstone for the plant, as the dispute over the legality of the building permit is still pending.
"If the buildings and facilities of the factory are built before the litigation ends, but the complaint is satisfied and the building permit is revoked, then the further course of events depends on the court's reasoning.
There is a possibility that the buildings turn out to be illegal, and in theory, they might have to be demolished," explained KÃ¤rt Vaarmari, a lawyer at the Environmental Law Center.
