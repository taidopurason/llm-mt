Alo Raun: congratulations, 55% support the civil partnership law!
55% - according to a questionnaire, the civil partnership law has gained majority support among Estonians who are 18 years old or older who have been asked to give their opinion.
These are the people who can vote for Parliament members and participate in referendums.
This was concluded from Norstat's September and October questionnaire results that were ordered by SA Liberaalne Kodanik.
This trend has been around for a while according to the same questionnaire.
So when talking about what "the people want" it is no longer accurate to say that we/they are against the civil partnership law.
