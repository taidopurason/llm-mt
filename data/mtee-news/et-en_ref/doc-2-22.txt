Reader's letter | A cry for help: you could only see legs kicking the shopping cart
A man rescued a child stuck under a pile of groceries in a shopping cart.
Should children even be in shopping carts?!
“I was on my weekly grocery run, moving to the refrigerated section, when I saw a pair of kicking legs.
At first, I did not understand what was happening, but then it hit me, there was a child stuck in the cart.
I couldn't be sure, but it seemed like the kid was trying to crawl out with their legs in front.
Or maybe the kid had slipped between the groceries and fallen over whilst trying to get back up,” recounts Siim on the situation in the shop.
