Good example: On holidays, Anett Kontaveit does not just sit idly but helps those in need
After an exhausting tournament in Mexico, the Estonian tennis star took some time off to rest in her homeland.
But she spends this time helping those in need.
Anett Kontaveit does not sit around idly but is practical about her use of time.
She posts about the plants she grows at home on Instagram, calling herself a "plant mom".
She also does volunteer work, raising awareness on the activities of Animal Shelters NGO.
Anett posted a picture of dogs on her social media, saying that she will be helping them this year as well.
On Monday's press conference, Anette Kontaveit said that her goal is to win the Grand Slam.
"I have thought about it for a few days," she told Delfi Sport.
"Of course I want to win the Grand Slam, but it is more important to set goals based on my own development.
I want to improve my games, specific tennis elements and my physical condition.
If I manage to develop well, better results will follow."
Kontaveit thanked her fans, who were awake at night during her games in Mexico. ”It was very heartwarming to see how many people were cheering for me.
I have gotten so much positive feedback and I am thankful to everyone that cares for what I do.
I would also like to thank my supporters and sponsors, who have made this all possible.”
After a short rest, Kontaveit will start her preparations for the new season in Tallinn and, as the Australian tournaments approach, she will fly to a warmer place to acclimatise.
