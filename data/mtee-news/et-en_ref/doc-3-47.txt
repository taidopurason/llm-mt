Singer Jessie J lost her child: I have no control of my emotions
The popular musician recently broke up with her partner Max Pham, but still decided to go through with her pregnancy and raise their child alone.
Sadly, the doctors could not detect the child's heartbeat in a recent scan, said Jessie J in her Instagram post.
“Yesterday morning I was laughing with a friend, saying: “Seriously though, how am I going to get through my gig in LA tomorrow night without telling the whole audience I am pregnant?”,” the singer wrote.
“By yesterday afternoon I was dreading the thought of getting through the gig without breaking down.
After going for my 3rd scan and being told there was no longer a heartbeat.
This morning.
I feel like I have no control of my emotions.
I might regret posting this. I might not.
I actually don't know.”
Despite the fact that she is grieving, she has decided to go through with her Los Angeles gig, believing that it might help her.
“I want to sing tonight.
Not because I am avoiding the grief or the process, but because I know singing tonight will help,” she wrote.
“I have done 2 shows in 2 years and my soul needs this.
Even more today.
I know some people will be thinking she should just cancel it but in this moment I have clarity on one thing.
I started singing when I was young for joy, to fill my soul and self love therapy.
That hasn't changed and I have to process this my way.”
Jessie J said that she had decided to raise the child alone because she had long waited to be a mum.
She knows that life is short and that getting pregnant was a miracle and an experience that she will never forget.
She hopes to get pregnant again in the future, but currently she is in shock and grieving.
“But I know I am strong, and I know I will be ok,” she added.
“I also know millions of women all over the world have felt this pain and even worse.”
