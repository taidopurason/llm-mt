French fishermen are blocking the English Channel for fishing rights
French fishermen are blocking ferry traffic in three ports in the English Channel and in a tunnel between France and Britain on Friday to demand post-Brexit fishing rights, the union said.
Gerard Romiti, chairman of The National Committee for Maritime Fisheries and Marine Livestock (CNPMEM), described the protest as a warning and said that traffic would be blocked in Saint-Malo, Ouistreham and Calais ports and in the Eurotunnel for several hours.
The ongoing dispute between Britain and France over fishing permits remains unresolved and threatens to escalate into a trade war.
"We do not want any donations; we just want our permits back," said Romiti.
"The United Kingdom must abide by the post-Brexit agreement.
We have held our tongues for 11 months.
Even professionals have limits.
We hope that this warning is heard." He did not deny further action.
France has threatened to ban British fishing vessels from bringing their catches to French ports and to impose stricter controls on all British imports.
According to President Emmanuel Macron, such measures should encourage negotiations, but French officials stress that all options are still on the table.
The talks between Clement Beaune, the French minister for European affairs, and David Frost, the British minister for Brexit, have not yet been successful.
According to last year's agreement between Britain and the European Union, European fishing vessels can continue fishing in British waters if they can prove that they have done so before.
Representatives from Paris say that the applications of several French vessels have been unjustifiably rejected.
Representatives from London deny this.
