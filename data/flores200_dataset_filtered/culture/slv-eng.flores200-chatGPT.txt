The military nature of the Roman Empire contributed to the advancement of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began training physicians, and they formed the first Roman medical corps dedicated to post-battle recovery.

The Roman Empire achieved significant medical progress over the centuries and laid the foundation for much of the knowledge we have today.
