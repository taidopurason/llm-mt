As already mentioned above, the possibilities of acquiring knowledge and learning have changed significantly, and thus the speed of knowledge acquisition has also changed.
There were several different ways of obtaining information. The emphasis was no longer so much on individual recall, but on the ability to retrieve text.
During the Renaissance, essential changes were introduced, particularly in the approach to learning and knowledge transmission.
Asynchronous communication allows time for reflection and responding to others.
It enables students to work at their own pace and control the speed of learning educational content.
Furthermore, due to the possibility of flexible working hours, there are fewer time constraints (Bremer, 1998).
Students can constantly access information using the internet and the World Wide Web.
Students can ask teachers questions throughout the day and expect relatively quick responses, eliminating the need to wait for the next face-to-face meeting.
Personal VPN (Virtual Private Network) providers are an excellent way to avoid political censorship and commercial geographic IP address filtering.
They are more powerful than web proxy servers, as they redirect all web traffic, not just http.
They usually offer higher bandwidth and better quality of service. Additionally, they are encrypted, providing better protection against eavesdropping.
Media companies have made it a habit to lie about its purpose, claiming it's for "anti-piracy" measures.
In reality, regional codes have no impact on illegal copying, as essential disk copies can be played on any device that plays the original.
In fact, companies aim to gain more control over their markets. It's all about money.
Since calls are made over the internet, you don't have to rely on a telecommunications service provider from your location or your destination.
Furthermore, there's no need to obtain a local number from the community you live in; satellite internet connection can be acquired in the remote town of Chicken, Alaska, and you can choose a number that suggests you're in sunny Arizona.
Often, a separate global number must be purchased to receive calls from PSTN phones. The origin of the number matters to callers.
Real-time text translation apps are applications that can automatically translate entire blocks of text from one language to another.
Some apps in this category can even translate foreign language texts on signs or other objects in the real world when the user points their smartphone at these objects.
Translation tools have greatly improved and provide almost accurate translations (occasionally with some nonsense), but they should be taken with caution as they can still completely miss the meaning.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which, after downloading the desired language data, allows offline translation.
Using GPS navigation apps on a smartphone might be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate abroad.
This can save you money that you would spend on new GPS maps, a standalone GPS device, or renting a device from a car rental company.
If you don't have a data connection on your phone or the phone is unreachable, the service will be limited or unavailable.
Around every corner, you're bombarded with a bewildering array of prepaid phone cards that can be used for both public payphones and regular phones.
Most cards are suitable for calling anywhere, but some are specialized for providing cost-effective calls to specific groups of countries.
Access to these services is often through a toll-free number that can be called for free from most phones.
