The 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline was shut down after thousands of barrels of crude oil spilled south of Fairbanks, Alaska.
A power outage following a fire system inspection caused relief valves to open and crude oil to overflow at Fort Greely's 9th Pumping Station.
The opening of the valves allowed the system to depressurize and the oil flowed onto the platform and from there into the 55,000 barrel (2.3 million gallon) storage tank.
As of Wednesday afternoon, the tank's vent valves were still leaking, believed to be due to thermal expansion within the tank.
Another secondary containment below the 104,500-barrel tanks was not yet completely filled.
