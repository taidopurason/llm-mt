800 miles of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System has been shut down due to the spill of thousands of barrels of crude oil south of the city of Fairbanks, Alaska.
A power outage following a routine fire protection system test caused safety valves to open and oil to overflow near the Fort Greely 9 gas station.
Opening the valves allowed the system to depressurize and the oil flowed onto the platform into a tank that holds 55,000 barrels (2.3 million gallons).
As of Wednesday afternoon, there was still a leak from the tank vent, likely caused by thermal expansion inside the tank.
Another secondary containment area below the tanks, capable of holding 104,500 barrels, has not yet been filled to its full capacity.
