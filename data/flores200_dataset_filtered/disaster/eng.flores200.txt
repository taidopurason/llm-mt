800 miles of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System were closed down following a spill of thousands of barrels of crude oil south of Fairbanks, Alaska.
A power failure following a routine fire-command system test caused relief valves to open and crude oil overflowed near the Fort Greely pump station 9.
The valves opening allowed a pressure release for the system and oil flowed on a pad to a tank that can hold 55,000 barrels (2.3 million gallons).
As of Wednesday afternoon, the tank vents were still leaking probably from thermal expansion inside the tank.
Another secondary containment area below the tanks capable of holding 104,500 barrels was not yet filled to capacity.
