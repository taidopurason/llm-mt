After thousands of barrels of crude oil spilled south of Fairbanks, Alaska, they have shut down an 800-mile trans-Alaska pipeline.
Due to a power outage following a routine fire detection system test, safety valves near Pump Station 9 in Fort Greely opened, causing a spill of crude oil.
The opening of the valves caused a drop in pressure in the system, and the oil leaked from the tank into a reservoir capable of holding 55,000 barrels (2.3 million gallons).
On Wednesday afternoon, the valves on the tanks were likely still leaking due to thermal expansion within the tank.
The second secondary containment area, with a capacity of 104,500 barrels, has not yet been filled.
