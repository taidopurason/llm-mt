"Hesperonychus elizabethae is a species belonging to the family Dromaeosauridae and is a relative of the velociraptor.
This feathered, warm-blooded predator was supposed to walk upright on two legs and had claws similar to those of a velociraptor.
Its second claw was larger, hence the name Hesperonychus, which means 'western claw.'
When the capsule approaches Earth at 5 o'clock (ET) and enters the atmosphere, a beautiful fireworks display is expected, visible in northern California, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah.
The capsule will resemble a shooting star as it crosses the sky.
The capsule will travel at about 12.8 km or 8 miles per second, so fast that it could travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles in one minute.
Stardust will set a new world record for the fastest return of a spacecraft to Earth, surpassing the previous record set in May 1969 with the return of the Apollo X command module.
'It will travel across the west coast of northern California and illuminate the sky from California to central Oregon, continuing over Nevada and Idaho to Utah,' said Tom Duxbury, project manager of the Stardust project.
This is the largest acquisition in eBay's history.
The company aims to expand its network of profitable sources and increase its popularity in areas where Skype dominates, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.
Scientists suspected that Enceladus is geologically active and a potential source of Saturn's icy E ring.
Enceladus is the most reflective body in the solar system, reflecting about 90 percent of the sunlight that strikes it.
Based on this fossil, it can be concluded that the divergence is much older than molecular evidence had suggested.
This means that everything needs to be shifted," said a researcher at the Rift Valley Research Service in Ethiopia and co-author of the study, Berhane Asfaw.
This is said to be the fifth time in history that people have witnessed chemically confirmed Martian material falling to Earth.
Out of approximately 24,000 meteorites known to have fallen on Earth, only about 34 are confirmed to originate from Mars.
Fifteen of these rocks are attributed to meteor showers from last July.
Some of these very rare rocks are sold for $11,000 to $22,500 per ounce, roughly ten times the price of gold.
Dark energy is an entirely invisible force that constantly acts on the universe.
Its existence is known solely because of its impact on the expansion of the universe.
Scientists have found that features called scarps, which appear on the moon's surface, are the result of very slow lunar contraction.
These scarps are found all over the moon and appear to have changed very little due to weathering, indicating that the geological events that created them occurred recently.
This theory contradicts the claim that there is no geological activity on the Moon.
It will behave like water. It is also as colorless as water.
If you were standing on the shore, you would see all the pebbles or debris on the bottom.
As far as we know, there is only one planetary body that looks more dynamic than Titan, and that is Earth," Stofan added.
The unmanned lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1 launched its impact probe (MIP), which traveled over the Moon's surface at a speed of 1.5 kilometers per second (3000 miles/hour) and successfully crashed near the Moon's south pole.
The lunar probe carried not only three important scientific instruments but also the Indian national flag on all its sides.
Leonov, also known as "Cosmonaut No. 11," was part of the original Soviet cosmonaut team.
On March 18, 1965, he performed the first human extravehicular activity (EVA) or "spacewalk," spending just under twelve minutes outside the spacecraft.
He received the highest honor of the Soviet Union, the "Hero of the Soviet Union," for his work.
Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission, marking the end of the space race.
The station maintained its position throughout the spacewalk, even though they lost a gyroscope at the beginning of the mission.
Chiao and Sharipov reported being safely away from the attitude control thrusters.
Russian flight control activated the thrusters, and the station was returned to its normal orientation.
The International Seismological Bureau's map of earthquakes for the past week did not show any earthquakes in Iceland.
In the last 48 hours, the Icelandic Meteorological Office also did not record any seismic activity in the Hekla area.
Significant seismic activity leading to a phase change occurred on March 10 on the northeast side of the caldera at the top of the volcano.
There were reports of dark clouds at the base of the mountain not associated with any volcanic activity.
The clouds raised some doubt as to whether an eruption had actually occurred.
A steel needle floats on water due to surface tension.
Surface tension occurs because water molecules at the water's surface are strongly attracted to each other more than to the air molecules above them.
Water molecules create an invisible layer on the water's surface, allowing certain objects like a needle to float on water.
When transitioning from running a quarter mile to running a half mile, speed becomes considerably less important, and endurance becomes essential.
A top middle-distance runner, someone who can cover the distance in less than two minutes, must certainly be fast, but they must prioritize endurance at all costs.
The best preparation for the track season is winter cross-country training combined with upper-body exercises.
Good nutritional habits alone cannot create exceptional results, but they can significantly impact the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, efficient hydration habits, and understanding the various aspects of supplement use can help athletes improve performance and enjoy sports more.
Middle-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport, but there are many misconceptions about some of the necessary equipment for participation.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most will have little or almost no impact on performance."
Athletes might prefer a product even if it doesn't have actual advantages.
The atom can be considered one of the fundamental building blocks of all matter.
It's a complex entity that, according to the simplified Bohr model, consists of a central nucleus around which electrons orbit, similar to planets around the sun – see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus is composed of two particles – neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge, neutrons are neutral, and electrons have a negative electric charge.
To examine a victim, you must first investigate the scene for your own safety.
As you approach the victim, you need to pay attention to their position and anything that might be sticking out.
If you injure yourself while providing help, you might only make things worse.
A study has shown that depression, fear, and catastrophizing are a result of the relationship between pain and disability in individuals suffering from back pain.
Only the consequences of catastrophizing were influenced by regularly structured weekly physical activity sessions, not depression and fear.
Those who engaged in any form of physical activity regularly needed more support in terms of perceiving pain negatively. They had to distinguish between chronic pain and discomfort from regular physical movement.
Vision or the ability to see depends on the optical system of the sense organ or eyes.
There are many different eye structures with varying levels of complexity, depending on the organism's needs.
Different structures have different capabilities, sensitivity to different wavelengths, and provide different degrees of sharpness. They also require different processing for meaningful input and optimal functioning of different numbers.
A population is a group of organisms of a specific species within a designated geographical area.
When a specific phenotypic trait is identical in all individuals in the population, these individuals are monomorphic.
When individuals exhibit multiple variants of a specific trait, they are polymorphic.
Colonies of warrior ants also move and nest in different phases.
During the nomadic phase, warrior ants move at night and stop to rest during the day.
The colony enters the nomadic phase when food supplies diminish. In this phase, the colony constructs temporary nests that they change daily.
Each such nomadic raid or march lasts around 17 days.
What is a cell? The term "cell" comes from the Latin word "cella," meaning "small room." It was first used by a scientist observing cork structure through a microscope.
A cell is the basic unit of all living beings, and all organisms are composed of at least one cell.
Cells are so fundamental and crucial to the study of life that they are often referred to as the "building blocks of life."
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve signals throughout the body, ensuring a normal and smooth blood flow.
These nerve impulses can travel rapidly throughout the body, aiding the body in protecting itself from potential dangers.
Compared to other severe storms, tornadoes affect only a small area but leave destruction in their wake.
Tornadoes uproot trees, rip boards from structures, and hurl cars into the air. The most powerful two percent of tornadoes last over three hours.
These violent storms contain winds with speeds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
People have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands of years.
The first true telescopes were crafted in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes utilized a combination of two lenses to magnify and bring distant objects closer.
Greed and selfishness will always accompany us, and the nature of collaboration is such that in the short term, you can always gain more by behaving selfishly when most benefit from it.
Ideally, most people will realize that long-term cooperation is their best choice.
Patterns of convergent thinking are problem-solving techniques that combine different ideas or fields to find solutions.
At the core of this thinking are speed, logic, and precision, along with recognizing facts, reusing existing approaches, and gathering information.
In this thinking, the most important factor is this: there's only one correct answer. You can come up with two answers: either the correct one or the incorrect one.
This way of thinking is associated with specific scientific or standard procedures.
People who think this way are capable of recognizing patterns, solving problems, and working with scientific texts.
Humans are by far the most adept species at reading the thoughts of others.
This means we can successfully predict what other people perceive, intend, believe, know, and desire.
Among these abilities, understanding others' intentions is most important. It allows us to resolve ambiguities in physical actions.
For instance, if we saw someone breaking a car window, we would likely assume they're trying to steal someone else's car.
If they were attempting to break into their own car because they lost their keys, we would interpret it differently.
MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (from Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, atoms emit tiny radio signals due to a magnetic field and radio waves.
In 1970, medical doctor and researcher Raymond Damadian established the use of magnetic resonance as a tool for medical diagnostics.
Four years later, they were granted a patent, the world's first issued MRI patent.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first whole-body imaging device using magnetic resonance, which he named the "Indomitable."
