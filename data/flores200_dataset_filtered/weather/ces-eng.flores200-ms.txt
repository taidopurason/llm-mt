In addition to the crushing ice, rescue efforts also faced extreme weather conditions.
Pittman indicated conditions won't improve until next week.

Felicia, formerly a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, weakened to a tropical low pressure and dissipated Tuesday.
The remnants caused downpours throughout the islands, but so far without reports of devastating flooding.
The 16.1 cm rainfall measured on Oahu was described as "beneficial".
Some of the rains were accompanied by storms and frequent lightning.
A tornado is a rotating column of air with very low pressure that draws in and upwards the surrounding air.
They cause very strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, which then move along with the tornado.
They start as funnels that descend from storm clouds, and "tornadoes" happen on contact with the ground.
