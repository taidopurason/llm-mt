In addition to breaking ice, rescue efforts are hampered by extreme weather conditions.
Pittman hinted that the situation would not improve until next week.
The amount and thickness of the ice sheets is the worst it has been for sealers in 15 years, according to Pittman.
Felicia, which was once classified as a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, weakened into a tropical depression before dissipating on Tuesday.
It left torrential rain across almost all the islands, although no damage to property or flooding has yet been reported.
The rainfall, which reached 6.34 inches on the gauge on Oahu, was described as "beneficial".
Some of the rainfall was accompanied by thunderstorms and frequent lightning.
A tornado is a swirling column of air of extremely low pressure that pulls the surrounding air in and upwards.
They generate strong winds (often 100-200 mph) and can lift heavy objects and carry them in the direction of the tornado's motion.
They start out looking like funnels descending from storm clouds, but develop into "tornadoes" on contact with the ground.
