Felicia, once a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, weakened to a tropical depression before dissipating Tuesday.

A tornado is a spinning column of very low-pressure air, which sucks the surrounding air inward and upward.
They generate high winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them as the tornado moves.
They begin as funnels descending from storm clouds, and become "tornadoes" when they touch the ground.
