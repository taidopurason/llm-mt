The red tide is caused by unusually high concentrations of Karenia brevis, a marine unicellular organism that occurs naturally.
With the convergence of natural factors, ideal conditions can arise, allowing for a drastic increase in the number of algae.
These algae produce a neurotoxin that can paralyze nerves in both humans and fish.
Due to the high concentrations of the toxin in the water, fish often die.
People can be affected by inhaling contaminated water carried into the air by winds and waves.
The winds of Tropical Cyclone Gonu, named "Gonu" in the language of the Maldives after a bundle of palm fronds, reached speeds of up to 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour) at their peak.
This morning, the winds were reaching speeds of about 83 km/h, and it was expected that they would continue to weaken.
When the ship was damaged and strong winds and waves threw it onto the breakwater, it had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board.
Twelve crew members were rescued by helicopters, and apart from a broken nose, there were no other injuries.
The 100-meter-long ship was en route to pick up its usual cargo of fertilizer, and authorities initially feared that the vessel could spill its cargo.
