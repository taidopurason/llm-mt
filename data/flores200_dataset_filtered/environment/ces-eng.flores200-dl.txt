The red tide is caused by a higher concentration of Karenia brevis, a naturally occurring unicellular marine organism.
Potentially, a combination of natural factors may create ideal conditions that will lead to a significant increase in algal abundance.

Humans can be affected by inhaling the affected water, which becomes airborne through wind and waves.
