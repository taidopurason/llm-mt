Red tide is caused by a higher than normal concentration of Karenia brevis, a naturally-occurring single-celled marine organism.
Natural factors can intersect to produce ideal conditions, allowing this algae to increase in number dramatically.
The algae produces a neurotoxin that can disable nerves in both humans and fish.
Fish often die because of the high concentrations of the toxin in the waters.
Humans can be affected by breathing affected water taken into the air by wind and waves.
