The games kicked off at 10:00am with great weather and apart from mid morning drizzle which quickly cleared up, it was a perfect day for 7's rugby.
Tournament top seeds South Africa started on the right note when they had a comfortable 26 - 00 win against 5th seeded Zambia.
Looking decidedly rusty in the game against their southern sisters, South Africa however steadily improved as the tournament progressed.
Their disciplined defence, ball handling skills and excellent team work made them stand out and it was clear that this was the team to beat.
