The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, the bridge is 378 metres long and has two lanes 3.5 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The construction was completed in August 2011, and operations did not begin until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, but you may have success with British and American currency. Be sure to ask the owners in advance what payment method you can use.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so make the exchange before you leave.
