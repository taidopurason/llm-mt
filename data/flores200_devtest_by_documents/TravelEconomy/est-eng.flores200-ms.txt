The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set at the rate of one British pound (GBP).
It is possible to exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere in the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted at Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outlying islands, although the currency of Great Britain and the United States may be accepted; Consult with owners beforehand to determine which is the appropriate payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
