The Oyapock River Bridge is a bridge with diagonal bracing. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two passageways 3,5 metres wide.
The bridge stands 15 metres high. It was built in August 2011 and only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints will also be completed.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), and its value is set at par with that of the British Pound (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West shop.
Sterling is accepted on virtually all the islands, but credit cards and US dollars are also accepted on Stanley.
The outer islands are unlikely to accept credit cards, but may accept British and US currency; check with the owners in advance which payment method is acceptable.
Falkland Islands currency is almost impossible to exchange outside the islands, so exchange cash before you leave.
