The Oyapock river bridge is a wing bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the town of Oiapoque in Brazil and the town of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 metres, the bridge is 378 metres long and has two lanes 3.5 metres wide.
The span of the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs facilities are expected to be completed.
The Falkland Islands' official currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set at one British Pound (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley often accepts credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in the outer islands, although UK and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners to ascertain the appropriate method of payment.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside the islands is almost impossible, so change money before leaving the islands.
