The D-Day landings and the following battles had freed the north of France, but the south still wasn't free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
