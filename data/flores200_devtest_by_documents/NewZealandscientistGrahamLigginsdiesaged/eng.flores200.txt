Liggins followed in his fatherâ€™s footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began to work at the Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital Liggins began to investigate premature labor during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered it would speed up the baby's foetal lung maturation.
