For children, the sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things to do in this area.
Before the show starts, you can see the pyramids in the dark and watch them in silence.
Usually, you can always hear the voices of tourists and traders. Sound and light tell the story just like a storybook.
The Sphinx has been made into a spectacle background and a long story teller.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated by lights.
