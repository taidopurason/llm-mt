The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most exciting things for children in the area.
Before the show starts, you can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence.
Usually there is always the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is the background and the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
