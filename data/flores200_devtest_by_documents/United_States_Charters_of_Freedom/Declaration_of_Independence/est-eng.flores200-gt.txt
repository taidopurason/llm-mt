If you've seen the movie "National Trade", you may think that a treasure card was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true.Although something has been written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words" "Original Declaration of Independence, Date 4 July 1776" "were written. The text is reversed at the bottom of the document."
Although no one knows who wrote it, it is known that in its early years of life, a large parchment document (its dimensions 29 ¾ times 24 ½ inches) had been rolled.
This is likely that the note was simply added as a bridge.
