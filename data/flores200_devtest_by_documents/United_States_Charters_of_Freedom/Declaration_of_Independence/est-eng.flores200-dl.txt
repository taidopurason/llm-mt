If you've seen the film "National Treasure", you might guess that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"The words 'Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776' were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence." The text is located in the bottom margin of the document, turned upside down."
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early years the large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ by 24 ½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the note was simply added as a label.
