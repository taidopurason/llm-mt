If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words ''Original of the Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776'". The text is at the bottom of the document, turned upside down."
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the first years of its life a large parchment document (its dimensions are 29 3/4 times 24 1/2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it's likely that the note was simply added as a tag.
