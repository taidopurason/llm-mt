If you've seen the movie Treasure Hunters, you might think that a map to the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known with certainty, it is clear that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ x 24½ inches) was rolled up and stored not long after its creation.
It is likely, therefore, that the entry was added simply as an addendum.
