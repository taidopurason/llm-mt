If you have watched the movie The Treasure Forgotten, you may think that on the back of the declaration of independence, a treasure map is drawn.
That is not true.Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a map of the treasure.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "The original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776" were written.The text is written at the bottom of the document facing the head.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the big document on the parchment (measuring 29 3/4 inches times 24 1/2 inch) was stored in the form of a roll at the beginning of its life.
Therefore, it is possible that the bookmark was simply added as a mark.
