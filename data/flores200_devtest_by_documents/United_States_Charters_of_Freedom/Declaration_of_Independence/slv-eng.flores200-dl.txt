If you've seen the film Treasure of the Forgotten, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not true. Although there is some writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words 'Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776' were written. The text is written at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large parchment document (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was stored in scroll form early in its life.
It is therefore possible that the bookmark was simply added as a mark.
