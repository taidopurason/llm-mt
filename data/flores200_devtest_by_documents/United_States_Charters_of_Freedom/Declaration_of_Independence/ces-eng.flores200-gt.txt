If you have seen treasure hunters, you may think that a map for treasure has been drawn on the back of the Independence Declaration.
But this is not true.Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Independence Declaration there are words "The original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776".The text is on the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known with certainty, it is clear that a large parchment document (dimensions of 29¾ x 24½ inches) was not long after its creation into the role and stored.
It is therefore likely that the entry was simply added as a stick.
