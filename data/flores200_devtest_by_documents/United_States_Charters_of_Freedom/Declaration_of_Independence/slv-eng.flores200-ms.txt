If you watched The Treasure of the Forgotten, you might think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
This is not true. Despite the fact that something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The reverse of the Declaration of Independence marked the words 'The original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776'. The text is written at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that a large document on parchment (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was stored in the form of a roll at the beginning of its service life.
Therefore, it is possible that the bookmark was simply added as a tag.
