During the War of Independence, thirteen states first formed a weak central government, with Congress being its only branch under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state agencies, which often did not cooperate, to enforce laws.
It also had no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be supplemented. States took the central government lightly, so much so that their representatives were often absent.
