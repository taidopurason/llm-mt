During the American War of Independence, the thirteen colonies first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, of which Congress was the only part.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, in the absence of a national executive or judiciary, it relied on state governments, often uncooperative, to enact all legislation.
Nor did it have the power to repeal tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
