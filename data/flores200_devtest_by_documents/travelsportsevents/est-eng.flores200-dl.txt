The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the 1964 Games, will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympics twice.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation rules based on coronavirus do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were due to take place.
Most tickets are expected to be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥13,0000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
