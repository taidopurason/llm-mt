The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at different locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics since it was hosted back in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find this situation difficult.
Event cancellation policies can vary, but as recently as late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between JPY2,500 and JPY130,000, with regular tickets costing JPY7,000.
