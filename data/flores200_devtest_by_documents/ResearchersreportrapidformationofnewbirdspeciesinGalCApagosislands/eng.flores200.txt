A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorean Gal√°pagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the new species evolved in just two generations, though this process had been believed to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
