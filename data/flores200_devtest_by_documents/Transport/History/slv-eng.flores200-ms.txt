Walking was the first known means of transport, people began to walk upright two million years ago, when Homo Erectus (or rather, upright man) appeared.
Their ancestor Australopiek usually did not walk upright.
Features of two-legged walking are present on the fossils of the Australopitka from 4.2â€“3.9 million years ago, but the hominid Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
