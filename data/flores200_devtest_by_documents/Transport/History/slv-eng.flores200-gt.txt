Walking was the first known means of transport, people started walking upright two million years ago when homo erectus (or upright man) appeared.
Their ancestor of Australopitite usually did not walk upright.
Features of two -legged walking are present on the Australopitian fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but Hominid Sahelanthropus could have walked two feet seven million years ago.
