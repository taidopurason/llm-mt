Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the prior CEP's resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that started in October.
The sometimes-violent protests were triggered by failure to hold elections, some due since 2011.
