The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member country.
Economic links have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure in political negotiations.
The major religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
