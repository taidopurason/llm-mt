South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
