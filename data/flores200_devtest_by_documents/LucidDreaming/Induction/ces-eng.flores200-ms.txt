Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up from normal sleep and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is easily achieved by using a relatively silent alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm while you're sleeping, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed in order to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleep, as they force the person to get up and go to the toilet.
