Sleep interruption is a procedure during which you deliberately wake up during normal bedtime and fall asleep again soon (after 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively silent alarm clock that will awaken you, but not wake you up.
If you're going to be resetting your sleep alarm, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of liquids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before going to bed, forcing a person to get up and go for water.
