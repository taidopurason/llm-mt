Interrupted sleep is a process during which you deliberately wake up during your normal sleep time and fall back asleep shortly afterwards (after 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done with a relatively quiet alarm clock, which will startle but not wake you.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room to force yourself out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to bed, which forces the person to get up and go for a drink.
