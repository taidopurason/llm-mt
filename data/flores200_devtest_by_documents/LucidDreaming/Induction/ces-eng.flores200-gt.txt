Sleep interruption is the process of deliberate awakening from normal sleep and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to achieve by using a relatively quiet alarm that brings you to consciousness without awakening you.
If you find that you turn off the alarm from sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm -based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretics) before sleeping, forcing a person to get up and reach the toilet.
