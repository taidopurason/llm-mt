Sleep disturbance is a purposefully awakening process during the usual sleep period and shortly after falling asleep (10-60 minutes).
It's easy if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness but does not completely wake you up.
If you find that you turn off the alarm clock while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room, so you are forced to get up from the bed to press it.
Other biorhythmic options include plenty of fluid drinking (especially water or a well -known diuretic tea) before going to bed to force yourself to wake up to urinate.
