Discontinue sleep is a procedure during which you are deliberately waking up during the usual sleep and falling asleep again (after 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will make you tooager but not awaken.
If you are going to reset your alarm clock, you can place it on the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking a large amount of liquids (especially water or tea, which is a well -known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing a person to get up and go to water.
