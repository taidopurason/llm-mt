Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in a subtropical belt;In summer, temperatures often exceed +30 Â° C.
Winter can be misleading: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but due to the wind and humidity mixture, it seems cooler than the thermometer.
There are no special "rainy" and "dry" periods: the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
