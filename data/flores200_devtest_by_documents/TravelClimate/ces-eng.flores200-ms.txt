Because Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is when it's cold in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 Â°C are common.
Winters can be precariously cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but together with wind and humidity, it seems colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "drought" seasons: The amount of precipitation remains approximately the same throughout the year.
