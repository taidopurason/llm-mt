As Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; temperatures often exceed +30 Â°C in summer.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the mix of wind and humidity makes it seem colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific 'rainy' and 'dry' periods: the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
