Since Montevideo is south of the equator, there is summer when winter is in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in the subtropical belt; in summer, temperatures often exceed +30Â°C.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but due to the mixture of wind and humidity, it appears cooler than the thermometer shows.
There are no special "rainy" and "dry" periods: the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
