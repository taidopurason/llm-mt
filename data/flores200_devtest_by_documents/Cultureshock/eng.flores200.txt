Re-entry shock comes on sooner than culture shock (there's less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who had an easy time adjusting to the new culture sometimes have a particularly hard time readjusting to their native culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you've adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you went abroad at first, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home.
