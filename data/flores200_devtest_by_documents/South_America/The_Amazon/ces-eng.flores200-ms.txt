The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth. More than eight times more water flows through it than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places up to six miles wide.
Fully 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
