German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbour Austria.
Fruity flavours are common, with apples baked into pastries all year round and cherries and plums making their appearance in summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts are also found in many German pastries. The popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
