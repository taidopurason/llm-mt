Women: It is recommended that all female travellers report themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also a good idea to wear a ring (just be careful not to make it look too expensive).
Women should keep in mind that due to cultural differences, they can sometimes experience harassment and that it is not uncommon for a man to follow a woman while walking, grab her hand, etc.
Be adamant about rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't justify this!).
Reindeer farming is an important livelihood among the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many other professions.
However, not all Sami traditionally engaged in large-scale reindeer breeding, they also made their living by fishing, hunting and similar activities, and then used reindeer only as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important income in SÃ¡pmi, a Sami region.
Although the term 'gypsy' is used extensively especially among non-Roma populations, it is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
The shock of returning comes earlier than the culture shock (there is a smaller phase of initial enthusiasm), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travellers who have easily adapted to a new culture often have a particularly challenging experience of readjusting to their native culture.
After returning home from a stay abroad, you are used to a new culture and you have already lost some of your habits from home.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, because they knew that travellers in a new country had to adapt.
What people may not realize is that travellers returning home also need patience and understanding.
