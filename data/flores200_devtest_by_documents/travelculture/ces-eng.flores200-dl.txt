Women: it is recommended that all female travellers declare themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also a good idea to wear a ring (just be careful not to make it look too expensive).
Women should bear in mind that due to cultural differences they may sometimes encounter harassment and that it is not unusual for a man to follow a woman as she walks, grab her arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not justify this!).
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture associated with the trade is also important to many other professions.
However, not all Sámi traditionally engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; they also made a living from fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer only as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern trades. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, a Sami area.
Although the term 'gypsy' is used extensively, particularly among the non-Roma population, it is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
Return shock comes earlier than culture shock (there is less of an initial enthusiasm phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have adapted easily to a new culture often have a particularly challenging experience of readjusting to their home culture.
When you return home from your time abroad, you are accustomed to the new culture and have lost some of the habits from home.
When you first went abroad, people were likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travellers have to adapt in a new country.
What people may not realize is that patience and understanding are also needed by travelers returning home.
