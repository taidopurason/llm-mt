Both cyanuric acid and melamine were found in urine samples from pets that died after consuming contaminated pet food.
The two compounds react with one another to form crystals that may block kidney function, researchers at the university said.
The researchers observed crystals formed in cat urine by the addition of melamine and cyanuric acid.
The composition of these crystals matches those found in the urine of affected pets when compared by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
