Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, as part of a package of measures to move the country closer to new elections, the Presidential Commission proposed the prior resignation of the CEP.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, which have also been violent at times, were triggered by the failure of elections, some of which should have taken place in 2011.
