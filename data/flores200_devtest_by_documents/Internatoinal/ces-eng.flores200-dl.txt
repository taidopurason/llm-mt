Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures used to move the country towards new elections.
The commission represented Martelly's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections and some have been ongoing since 2011.
