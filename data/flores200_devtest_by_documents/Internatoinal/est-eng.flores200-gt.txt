Yesterday, Martelly sworn in a new electoral council of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth temporary electoral body (CEP) for four years.
Last month, the President's Commission made a recommendation to resign the previous active president as part of the package of measures to bring the state to the new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to large -scale anti -regime protests that began in October.
Occasionally, the failure to organize the elections was the failure of violent protests, some of which were expected from 2011.
