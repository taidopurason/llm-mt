Martelly was sworn in yesterday in a nine-member Interim Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, as part of a package of measures to move the country closer to the new elections, the Presidential Commission proposed the prior resignation of the Interim Electoral Council.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the indiscriminate anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by failed elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
