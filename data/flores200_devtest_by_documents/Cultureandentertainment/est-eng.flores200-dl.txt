Aerosmith have cancelled the remaining shows on their tour.
The rock band was due to tour the US and Canada until 16 September.
They cancelled the tour after lead singer Steven Tyler fell off stage while performing on 5 August and was injured.
The programme started at 8.30pm local time (15.00 UTC).
Singers from all over the country performed bhajans or songs dedicated to the feet of Shri Shyam.
The evening began with singer Sanju Sharma, followed by Jai Shankar Choudhary.
Lakkha Singh then took over the singing of the bhajans.
Baba Shyam was served 108 plates of Chhappan Bhogi (in Hinduism, 56 different foods such as sweets, fruits, nuts, dishes, etc. were offered to the deity).
Lakkha Singh also performed chhappan bhog bhajan. Singer Raju Khandelwal accompanied him.
