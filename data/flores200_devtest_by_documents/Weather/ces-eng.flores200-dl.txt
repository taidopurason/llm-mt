Today, the tenth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Subtropical Storm Jerry, formed in the Atlantic Ocean.
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) says Jerry poses no threat to land at this time.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates that 15 cm of rainfall could lead to the breaching of already damaged levees.
The Ninth Ward, which was flooded to 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, now has water up to an adult's waist because a nearby floodwall overtopped.
Water is overflowing over the levee for a 30-foot-wide stretch.
