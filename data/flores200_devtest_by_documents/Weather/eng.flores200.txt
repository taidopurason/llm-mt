The tenth named storm of the Atlantic Hurricane season, Subtropical Storm Jerry, formed in the Atlantic Ocean today.
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) says that at this point Jerry poses no threat to land.
The U.S. Corps of Engineers estimated that 6 inches of rainfall could breach the previously damaged levees.
The Ninth Ward, which saw flooding as high as 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, is currently in waist-high water as the nearby levee was overtopped.
Water is spilling over the levee in a section 100 feet wide.
