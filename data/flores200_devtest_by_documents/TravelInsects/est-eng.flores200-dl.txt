Travellers may find animal pests not known in their home area.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually classified as pests.
