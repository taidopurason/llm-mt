Travelers may encounter animal pests unknown in their home regions.
Troublesome insects can cause spoilage of food, skin irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, the spread of poison or the transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force are usually not classified as pests as such.
