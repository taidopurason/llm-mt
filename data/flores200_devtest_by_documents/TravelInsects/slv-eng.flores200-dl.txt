Travellers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause sensitisation or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, emit poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are not usually considered pests.
