Travellers may encounter animal pests that they are unfamiliar with in their home regions.
Nuisance insects can cause food spoilage, skin irritation or, in worse cases, allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
As such, infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill humans are not usually classified as pests.
