If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in the winter you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
As the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
