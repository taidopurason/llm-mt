The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Maria Tereza and four-year-old Ludv√≠k-Karel) and the king's sister Elizabeth of the Philippines were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
They went back to Paris with a carriage surrounded by a turbulent crowd and shouted the threats to the king and the queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and the queen to leave the windows of his carriage widely wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of the criminal group waved the head of the royal guard in front of the collapse.
