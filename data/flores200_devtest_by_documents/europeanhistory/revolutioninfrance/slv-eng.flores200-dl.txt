On 6 October 1789, a frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the Queen's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by an angry crowd of women readers to flee Versailles for Paris.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and shouted threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a member of the Royal Guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
