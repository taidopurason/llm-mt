On 6 October 1789, a terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Elisabeth Philippine of France, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris from Versailles.
They went back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a riotous mob shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of the criminal group waved the head of the royal guard in front of the horrified queen.
