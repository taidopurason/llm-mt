The frightened King of Louis XVI, Queen Maria Antoaneta, their young children (11-year-old Maria Teresa and four-year-old Ludwik Karl) and King's Sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, forced the crowded masses to retreat from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris with a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who yelled and shouted threats to the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage to the bank.
At some point, someone from the crowd before the scared queen waved the head of a member of the royal guard killed in Versailles.
