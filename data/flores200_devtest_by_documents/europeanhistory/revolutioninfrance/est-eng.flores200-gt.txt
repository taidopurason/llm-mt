Frightened Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to leave Versailles on October 6, 1789 to leave the Paris Market Women's gang.
They traveled back to Paris in the translation, surrounded by a folk power that screamed and screamed at the king and the queen.
The folk power forced the king and the queen to open the windows of the gig.
At one point, one of the members of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles.
