Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective - it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated universally accepted international law, enshrined in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering whole areas of the ocean, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
As there was no particular reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
