Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy of cutting off vital military and civilian supplies proved effective, but the blockade broke generally accepted international law, codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire areas of the ocean, thereby endangering even neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
