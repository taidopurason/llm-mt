Shortly after the outbreak of hostility, Britain established a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy, which discontinued the most important military and civilian care, has proven effective, but this blockade has violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
The UK mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing the entire ocean areas, which also threatened neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unlimited submarine warfare.
