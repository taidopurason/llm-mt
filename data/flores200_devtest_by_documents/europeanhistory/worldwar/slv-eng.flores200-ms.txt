Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy of cutting off the most important military and civilian supplies has proved effective, but this blockade has violated universally accepted international law, which has been codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire areas of the ocean, putting neutral ships at risk.
Since the answer to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unlimited submarine warfare.
