Soon after the outbreak of clashes, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated universally accepted international law codified by several international agreements dating back two centuries.
Britain cruised international waters to prevent ships from reaching entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic met with only a limited reaction, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestrained undersea military forces.
