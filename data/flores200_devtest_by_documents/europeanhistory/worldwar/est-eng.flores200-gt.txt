Shortly after the start of hostilities, the British German blockade began.
The strategy turned out to be effective - it cut off the vital military and civilian stocks, although this blockade violated the generally accepted international law, which has been written down in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain installed mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering whole ocean areas, threatening even neutral bases.
As there was no particular reaction to this tactic, Germany waited for a similar answer to its unlimited submarine warfare.
