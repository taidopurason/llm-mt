Soon after the outbreak of clashes, Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective because it interrupted vital military and civilian supply, although this blockade violated the generally adopted international law codified by several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain crossed international waters so that no ships could not get into the whole area of the ocean, which was a danger for neutral ships.
Since this tactic encountered a limited reaction, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater military forces.
