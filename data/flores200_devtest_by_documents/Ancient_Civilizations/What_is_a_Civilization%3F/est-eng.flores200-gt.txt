Civilization is a single culture, which is shared by a remarkably large group of people living and working.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word in Civil, which means a "civic" related to Latin for civis, "citizen", and civitas, which means "city or city country", and to some extent defines the size of society.
City states are the forerunners of the countries.Civilization culture means conveying knowledge over several generations, a permanent cultural footprint and sufficient cultural broadcast.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving appropriate historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
