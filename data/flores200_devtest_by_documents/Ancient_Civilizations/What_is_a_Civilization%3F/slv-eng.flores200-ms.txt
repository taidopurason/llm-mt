Civilization is a unique culture that is common to a large group of individuals who live and participate together, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civic and is related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, which in some way also denotes the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. The culture of civilization involves the passing on of knowledge through generations, a lasting cultural trace and a significant distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces behind, so they cannot be considered true civilizations.
