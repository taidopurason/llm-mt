A civilisation is a unique culture shared by a large group of individuals living and working together, a society.
The word civilisation is derived from the Latin word civilis, which means citizen, and is related to the Latin words civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which in a sense also denotes the size of society.
City states are the precursors of nations. The culture of civilisation involves the transmission of knowledge over generations, a lasting cultural footprint and significant diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces and cannot be considered as true civilisations.
