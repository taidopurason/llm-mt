A civilisation is a single culture shared by a significant group of people living and working together - a society.
The word civilisation comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning 'citizen', which is related to the Latin words civis, 'citizen', and civitas, meaning 'city or city-state', and to some extent defines the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of states. A civilised culture means the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and an adequate cultural transmission.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognised as true civilisations.
