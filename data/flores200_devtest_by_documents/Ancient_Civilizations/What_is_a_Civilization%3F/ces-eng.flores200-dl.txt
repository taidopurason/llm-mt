A civilization is a particular culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work in cooperation with each other, i.e. together they form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", meaning "civil", and it is related to the Latin "civis", meaning "citizen", and also "civitas", meaning city or city-state, and it also defines in a way the size of society.
The predecessors of nations were city states. The culture of a civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces, and adequate dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
