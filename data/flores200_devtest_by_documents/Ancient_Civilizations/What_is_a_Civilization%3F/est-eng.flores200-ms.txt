Civilization is a single culture shared by a remarkably large group of people living and working together, i.e. society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means "citizen", which is associated with the Latin words civis, "citizen", and civitas, which means "city or city-state", and it also to some extent defines the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of states. A civilisational culture means the transfer of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and sufficient cultural diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
