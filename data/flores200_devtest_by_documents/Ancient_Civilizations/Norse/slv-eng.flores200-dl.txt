Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and that he discovered Greenland on his way west and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in their people, kings, customs and history.
