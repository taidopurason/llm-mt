Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is written that Eric the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it the Green Land.
Despite his find, there were already Eskimo tribes living there.
Although all countries were part of "Scandinavia", there were many differences between the inhabitants, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
