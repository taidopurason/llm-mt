Greenland was sparsely populated. Nordic sagas say that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder and discovered Greenland on his way westwards, naming it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery, the tribes of the Eskimos already lived there at that time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between their people, kings, customs and history.
