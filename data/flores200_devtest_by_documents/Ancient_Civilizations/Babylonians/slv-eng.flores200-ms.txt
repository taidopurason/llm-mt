The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, which was supposed to represent the home of each god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods with rituals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers were built, called ziggurats, which were part of temples.
The top of the tower represented a special refuge for the god.
