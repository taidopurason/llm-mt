Babylonians built a main stamp for each of their God, which was considered God's home.
People were victims to the gods, and the priests took care of the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner shrine, which can only enter the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid -shaped towers, called cicurates, were built as part of the temples.
The tower was a special temple for God.
