The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered their home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctum where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine dedicated to the god.
