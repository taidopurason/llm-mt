The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, which was considered his home.
Humans offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The highlight of the tower was a special shrine designed for the god.
