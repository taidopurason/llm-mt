The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, which was supposed to represent the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs with rituals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctum that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
