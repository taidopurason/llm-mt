The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of God.
People brought offerings to the gods, and priests took care of the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner shrine that only priests can enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers were built as part of the temples, which are called cicadas.
The tower peak was a special sanctuary for god.
