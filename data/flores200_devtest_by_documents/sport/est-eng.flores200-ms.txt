The games started at 10:00 a.m. in fine weather, and after a mid-morning fog rain that quickly cleared up, it was a great day for rugby-7.
The South Adria, who got their first starting value of the tournament, started with the right foot, getting a comfortable 26:00 victory over the fifth-ranked Zambia.
Playing against their southern neighbours, South Africa made a very rusty impression, while still constantly improving themselves as the tournament progressed.
Their disciplined defense, ball-handling skills and excellent teamwork highlighted them and it was clear that they had to be overcome for a win.
South Africa defeated the New Zealand team "All Blacks" in a rugby union three-nation match held at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, South Africa.
The final result was a one-point win, 21:20, which ended the team's "All Blacks" 15-game winning streak.
For Springbox, it ended a five-match losing streak.
It was the last match for the All Blacks, they had already won first place two weeks ago.
The final match of the series will take place next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg when team Springboks plays against Australia.
