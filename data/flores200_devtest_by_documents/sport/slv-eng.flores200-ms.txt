The games started at 10:00 a.m. with great weather and, with the exception of a few drops of rain in the middle of the morning that soon quit, the day was perfect for a rugby seventh.
South Africa, the tournament's favorite, made a good start when it easily won 26:00 p.m. against the fifth carrier Zambia.
Although she acted a little out of shape in the race against her southern sisters, South Africa has made steady progress with the tournament.
They stood out for their disciplined defenses, skillful ball handling and excellent teamwork, and it was clear that it was the main opponent.
South Africans defeated All Blackse (New Zealand) at the Three Rugby Federation Nations championship at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, South Africa.
The end result was a one-point victory, 21 to 20, breaking the winning streak of 15 consecutive All Blacks matches.
FOR Springboks, this interrupted a series of five consecutive defeats in matches.
For the All Blacks, who won the trophy two weeks ago, this was the last match.
The last game in this series will take place next week in Ellis Park, Johannesburg, as the Springboxes face Australia.
