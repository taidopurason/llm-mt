California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law a bill that bans the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill requires violent video games sold in the state of California to be labeled with a decal reading "18" and makes their sale to a minor punishable by a fine of $1000 per offense.
