Finland is a great destination for boating. This land of the so-called thousand lakes also has a thousand islands, which are located both in lakes and in coastal archipelagoes.
You don't necessarily need a yacht ship to sail between the archipelago and the lakes.
While coastal archipelagoes and larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks allow for a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, there is one boat for every seven to eight people.
The figures are equivalent in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is a unique phenomenon (e.g. in the Netherlands, the figure is one per forty).
Most different Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you have a few full days to visit the historic city, while you can return to the ship for the night and sleep there.
If you go ashore only with boat excursions, then you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
In the brochures of some hobby trips, the German city of Berlin is highlighted. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and visiting this city is not included in the price of an interest trip.
