Finland is a great destination for boating. This so-called land of a thousand lakes is also home to a thousand islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to sail between islands and lakes.
While coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed big enough for any kind of hunting, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven to eight people.
The figures are comparable in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is a unique phenomenon (e.g. in the Netherlands it is one for every forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises include a longer stopover in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means you have a couple of full days to visit the historic city, while you can return to the ship for the night and sleep there.
If you are going ashore with only boat excursions, you don't need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some excursion brochures highlight the German city of Berlin. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to this city is not included in the price of the excursion.
