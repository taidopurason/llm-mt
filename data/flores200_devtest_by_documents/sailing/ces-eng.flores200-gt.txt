Finland is a great destination for boat trips."A country of a thousand lakes" includes thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelago.
It is not essential to have a yacht on the archipelago and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are really sufficient for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayak will offer a different experience.
Boatting is a national entertainment in Finland - every seven to eight people fall here.
Similarly, it is in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (eg in the Netherlands this number one is forty).
Saying by the Baltic Sea mostly have a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit this historic city for several days and return to the ship at night and sleep on it.
If you only climb the shore within the navigation tours, you will not need a separate visa (valid since 2009).
Some tours in the brochure include the German Berlin.As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and the city visit is not included in the price of the tour.
