Finland is a great boating destination.In addition, the "land of thousands of lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the islands along the coast.
You do not need a yacht in archipelagas and lakes.
Although the coastal islands and largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a Finnish national sport, as the boat has a seventh or eighth person.
It is the same in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but quite rare (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most special Baltic Cruises include an extended stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that when you visit in the historic city, you can stay all day long, and at night you can return to the ship and sleep there.
If you go to land only with ship excursions, you will not need a special visa (from 2009 onwards).
Some cruises in brochures mention Berlin in Germany.As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
