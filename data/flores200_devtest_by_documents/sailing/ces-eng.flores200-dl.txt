Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also includes thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
On the archipelagos and lakes it is not necessarily necessary to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak will offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven to eight people.
This is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Baltic Sea cruises usually have a longer stay in St Petersburg, Russia, on the agenda.
This means that you can visit this historic city for several full days, returning to the ship at night to spend the night.
If you only go ashore as part of a cruise tour, you won't need a separate visa (valid since 2009).
Some tours in the brochure include Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the tour price.
