Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also includes thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
On archipelagos and lakes it is not absolutely necessary to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are really large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak will offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland â€“ there is one boat for every seven to eight people.
It is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands this number is one in forty).
Baltic Sea cruises usually have a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit this historic city for several full days and return to the boat at night and sleep on it.
If you go ashore only on cruise tours, you will not need a separate visa (valid since 2009).
Some tours in the brochure include German Berlin. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the tour.
