The shooters involved in the additional pest control experiment were strictly monitored by forest rangers, because the experiment was under surveillance and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In the partnership between NPWS and the Australian Shooting Athletes Association (NSW) Limited Company, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Shooting Athletes Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and cultural heritage at NPWS Park, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received thorough safety instructions and training.
