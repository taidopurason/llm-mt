Shooters were closely supervised by rangers during the supplemental pest management study as the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited under the auspices of the NPSW and NSW Inc (Australian Sporting Shooters Association) hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director in Conservation at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shoot received comprehensive safety training and coaching.
