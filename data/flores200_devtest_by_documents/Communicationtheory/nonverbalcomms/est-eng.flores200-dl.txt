The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of facial movements, or micro-movements, that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.

He even suggested that animals, such as domesticated dogs, also have this ability to interpret human behaviour.
