The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
Specific internet characteristics add another dimension in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are designed as important motivational elements for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)
"Personal engagement" and "continuing interest" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined the reactions of the audience to the website.
