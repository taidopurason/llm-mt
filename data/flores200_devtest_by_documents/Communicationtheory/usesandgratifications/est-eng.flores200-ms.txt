The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specifics of the Internet bring additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivating aspects as they studied audience reactions to websites.
