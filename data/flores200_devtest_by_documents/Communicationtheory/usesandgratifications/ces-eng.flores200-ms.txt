The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet add another dimension in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are proposed as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995)
"Personal engagement" and "continuing interest" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when examining audience responses to websites.
