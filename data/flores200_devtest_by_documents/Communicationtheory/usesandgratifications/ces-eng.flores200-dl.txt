The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet add another dimension in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivators to use the Internet (James et al., 1995)
'Personal involvement' and 'continuing interest' were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined audience responses to websites.
