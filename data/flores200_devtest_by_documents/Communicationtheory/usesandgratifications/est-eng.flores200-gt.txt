The Internet combines both mass communication and interpersonal communication elements.
The specific features of the Internet bring additional dimensions for use and satisfaction.
For example, "Learning" and "Socialization" (James et al., 1995) are highlighted as important incentives of using the Internet.
Eighy and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "continuing relations" as new motivational aspects as they studied audience reactions to websites.
