The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent characteristics of the Internet allow for new dimensions in terms of use and approach to reward.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are thought to be important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' have also been identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied how audiences respond to websites.
