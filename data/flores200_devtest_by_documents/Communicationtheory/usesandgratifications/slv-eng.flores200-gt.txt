The Internet combines both elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the Internet allow for new dimensions in terms of use and approach to reward.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" is supposed to be an important motivator for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also recognized the "personal participation" and "constant relationships" as new aspects of motivation as they examined how the audience responds to the websites.
