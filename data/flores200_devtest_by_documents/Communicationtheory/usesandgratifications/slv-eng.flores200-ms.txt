The Internet combines both elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the Internet allow for new dimensions in terms of usage and approach to reward.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are said to be important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal participation" and "constant relationships" were also recognized as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied how audiences react to websites.
