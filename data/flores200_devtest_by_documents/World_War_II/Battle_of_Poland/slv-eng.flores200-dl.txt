By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans became obsolete practically overnight, however, when 800,000 troops of the Soviet Red Army marched in and established the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern Polish regions, in contravention of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
