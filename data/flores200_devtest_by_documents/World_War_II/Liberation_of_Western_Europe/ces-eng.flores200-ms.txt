The Normandy landings and subsequent battles brought about the liberation of northern France, but the south of the country was not yet liberated.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy". It was the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invading forces instead of fighting.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French Forces liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
