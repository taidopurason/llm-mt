D-Day and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
The Vichy French ruled there. These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies invaded the south of France on 15 August 1940, an action that came to be known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the liberated French forces had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
