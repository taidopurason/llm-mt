The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, while southern France was still unconquered.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940, and who cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, Allied forces occupied southern France, an invasion called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French Free Forces liberated the south of France and headed towards Germany.
