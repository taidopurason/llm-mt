Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and take in the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Plants get their nutrition from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals could not survive.
