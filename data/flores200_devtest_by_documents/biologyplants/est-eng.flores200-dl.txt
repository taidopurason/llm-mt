Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans breathe out.
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
