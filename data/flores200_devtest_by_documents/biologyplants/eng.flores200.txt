Plants make oxygen which humans breathe, and they take in carbon-dioxide which humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most foods that we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
