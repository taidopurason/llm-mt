Plants create the oxygen that people breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that people expel from their lungs (or exhale).
Plants produce food by photosynthesis, with the help of the sun. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Animals could not survive without plants.
