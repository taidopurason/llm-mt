While project-based learning should be easier and more interesting, it goes one step further.
Project-based learning is not a teaching method, but rather a support to help individuals who are learning something new, such as using a new computer programme or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding, but this is also true of the little paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are an internal part of the software and are meant to ask questions, stimulate and explain procedures that might be too challenging for the learner themselves.
