Although project -based learning should simplify and make acquisition more interesting, the approach of educational scaffolding is a step forward.
The Scaffolding ('Support') method is not a learning method, but rather a way to support people who are gaining a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, both the teacher and the Microsoft Office small paper clip-man can be supported.
Virtual steps are integrated into the software, which aims to question, refer to and explain procedures that may be too complicated to cope alone for the student.
