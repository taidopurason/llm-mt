Children are built in foster care for a variety of reasons, which cover everything from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, loving and educational, but this is happening.
We think the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all urgent life goods that they did not have in the home from which they had previously been taken away.
