Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, loving and educational, yet this is happening.
We think that the foster care system for these children is a safe zone.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
Foster care was supposed to provide all necessary life goods that they did not have in the home from which they had previously been taken.
