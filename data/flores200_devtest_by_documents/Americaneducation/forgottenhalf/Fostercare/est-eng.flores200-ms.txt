Children are taken to orphanages for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing and educating, but it happens.
We find that the foster care system represents a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The foster family should ensure all the needs that were missing from the home, from which they were previously taken away.
