Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not supportive, loving and nurturing, and yet this is what happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving carers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide all the necessities of life that they did not have in the home from which they were previously removed.
