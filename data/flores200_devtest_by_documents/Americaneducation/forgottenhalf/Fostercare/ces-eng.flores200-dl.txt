Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where they are not properly nourished, cared for and educated, but such cases do exist.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide for all the needs that were not met in the home from which they were previously removed.
