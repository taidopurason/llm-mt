Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment in which he or she does not receive proper nutrition, care and upbringing, but such cases exist.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is intended to provide for all needs that have not been met in the household from which they were previously removed.
