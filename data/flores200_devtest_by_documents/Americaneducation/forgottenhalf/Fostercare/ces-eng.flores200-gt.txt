Children are placed in foster care for a number of reasons that cover areas from neglect, abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment in which he does not receive proper nutrition, care and education, but there are such cases.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is to ensure all the needs that have not been filled in the household from which they were previously taken.
