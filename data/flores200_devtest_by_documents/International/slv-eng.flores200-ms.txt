UN peacekeepers arriving in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake are blamed for spreading the disease, which began near the troop camp.
According to the lawsuit, the rehabilitation of waste from the UN camp was inadequate, resulting in bacteria being introduced into the tributary of the Artibonite River, one of the largest in Haiti.
Until the arrival of troops, Haiti had not faced problems associated with this disease since the 19th century.
The Haitian Institute of Justice and Democracy has referred to independent research showing that UN Nepalese peacekeepers have unknowingly transmitted the disease to Haiti.
Danielle Lantagne, a UN expert on the disease, said the outbreak was probably caused by peacekeepers.
