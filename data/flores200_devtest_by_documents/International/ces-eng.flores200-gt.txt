The UN peaceful forces that arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake are accused of spreading the disease that broke out near the troops camp.
According to a legal action, waste from the UN camp was not correctly disinfected, allowing bacteria to enter the artibonite tributary, which is one of the largest in Haiti.
Before the arrival of troops, Haiti has not encountered problems associated with this disease since the beginning of the 19th century.
The Institute of Justice and Democracy in Haiti mentioned independent studies that indicate that the disease in Haiti unknowingly dragged the NEB -Nepalery peace units.
Danielle Lantagne, a UN expert on this disease, said the epidemic was probably caused by peace units.
