Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs, because they have feathers and are able to fly.
But birds still have several features that look like a dinosaur.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
