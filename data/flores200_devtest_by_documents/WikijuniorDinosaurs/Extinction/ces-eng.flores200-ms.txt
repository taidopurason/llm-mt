Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still a lot of features on birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
