Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day.We call them birds.
Many people do not think about them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still a lot of characters that resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, tolerate eggs and walk on their two back legs like T-Rex.
