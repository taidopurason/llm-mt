Many of today's paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day.We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But the birds still have several features that look like a dinosaur.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like T-REE.
