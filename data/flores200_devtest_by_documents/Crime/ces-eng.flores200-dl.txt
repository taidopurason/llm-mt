The widespread looting reportedly continued overnight as police officers were not present on the streets of Bishkek.
Bishkek was described by one observer as descending into a state of "anarchy". Gangs of people roamed the streets and looted consumer goods shops.
Several residents of Bishkek accused the protesters from the south of acting illegally.
