The widespread looting was expected to continue all night, as there were no police officers on the streets of Bishkek.
According to one of the observers, Bishkek sang into a state of "anarchy", as gangs walked through the streets and devastated consumer shops.
Some residents of Bishkek attributed this to the protesters from the south.
