The indiscriminate looting was supposed to continue throughout the night, as there were no police officers on the streets of Bishkek.
According to the description of one of the observers, Bishkek plunged into a state of "anarchy", as gangs roamed the streets and ravaged consumer goods shops.
Some residents of Bishkek attributed this lawlessness to protesters from the south.
