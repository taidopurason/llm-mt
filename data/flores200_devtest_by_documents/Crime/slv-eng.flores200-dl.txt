The looting is said to have continued throughout the night, as there were no police officers on the streets of Bishkek.
According to one observer, Bishkek was plunged into a state of "anarchy", with gangs roaming the streets and looting consumer goods shops.
Some Bishkek residents attributed this lawlessness to protesters from the south.
