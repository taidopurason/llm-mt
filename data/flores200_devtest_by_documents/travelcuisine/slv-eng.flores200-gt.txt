Major cuisine, like kitchens of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular dish, especially in summer, is Amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and all possible additives such as cheese, tuna, etc.
