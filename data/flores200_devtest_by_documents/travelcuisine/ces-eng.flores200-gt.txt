Mallorcan cuisine, similar to kitchens of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and often uses olive oil.
Simple and popular dinner, especially in summer is called PA AMB OLI: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
