Ironing damp clothes dries them faster. Many hotels rent irons and ironing boards if they are not already in the room.
If you don't have an iron handy, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause it to shrink or even fray).
