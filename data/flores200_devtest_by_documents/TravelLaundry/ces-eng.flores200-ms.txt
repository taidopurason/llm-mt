Ironing wet clothes can help him dry. Many hotels have ironing facilities available for rent, even if not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to heat up the fabric too much (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
