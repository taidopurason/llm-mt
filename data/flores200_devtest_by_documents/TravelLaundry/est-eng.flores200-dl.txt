Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed, even if they are not in your room.
If you don't have an iron handy, or if you don't want to wear striped socks, you could try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful that the fabric doesn't get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
