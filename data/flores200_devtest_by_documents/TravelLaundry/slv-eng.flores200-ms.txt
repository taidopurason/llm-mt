Ironing damp clothes dries them faster. Many hotels rent irons and ironing boards if they are not already present in the room itself.
If the iron is not at hand or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hair dryer if you have one.
Make sure that the goods do not get too hot (which may cause them to shrink or even become blind).
