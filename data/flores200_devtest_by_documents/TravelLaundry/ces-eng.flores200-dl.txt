Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for hire, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you don't like to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
