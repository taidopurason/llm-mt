This is called the pH value of the chemical. You can make your own indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
