This is called the chemical pH.You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes the color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) this chemical is.
The pH level shows the amount of hydrogen ions in the chemical studied (H is the hydrogen in the pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
