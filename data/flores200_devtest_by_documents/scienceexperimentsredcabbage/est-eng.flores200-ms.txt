This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make yourself an indicator with the juice of red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) this chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H denotes hydrogen in pH) in the studied chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons are removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
