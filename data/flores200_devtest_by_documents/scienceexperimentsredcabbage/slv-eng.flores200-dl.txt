These are called pH chemicals. You can already make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes colour according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The PH value of the chemicals tested is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
