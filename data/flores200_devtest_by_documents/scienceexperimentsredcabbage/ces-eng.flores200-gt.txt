This is called the pH of the chemical.You can create an indicator yourself using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color as the chemical is acidic or alkaline (alkaline).
The pH value is determined according to the amount of hydrogen ions (letter H in the ph) in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been taken (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
