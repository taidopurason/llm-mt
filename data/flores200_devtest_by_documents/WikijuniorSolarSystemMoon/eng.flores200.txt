The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise up to the surface.
