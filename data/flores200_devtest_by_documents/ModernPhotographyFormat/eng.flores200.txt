For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm in width by 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
