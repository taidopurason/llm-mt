A tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (genus panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full-throated roar, but more like a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
