The tiger is a good athlete and can climb (though not best), swims, skips long distances and pulls five times stronger than a strong man.
Tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars.These four large cat representatives are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger roar is not as full and uniform as the lion, but more cut off and flashy.
