The tiger, a versatile athlete, can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. Only these four cats can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's loud roar, but more like a sentence of roaring words.
