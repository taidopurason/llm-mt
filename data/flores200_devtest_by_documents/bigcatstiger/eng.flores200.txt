A well rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances and pull with five times the force of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of snarly, shouted words.
