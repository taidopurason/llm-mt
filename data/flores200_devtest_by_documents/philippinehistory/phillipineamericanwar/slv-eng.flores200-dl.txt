The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover most of the costs and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the break-even profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would constitute a basic income for US imperialism.
