Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are a lot of elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
