Humans have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as they can be found naturally in nature and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle postulated that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like the four states of aggregation (in the same order) - solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma - although he also speculated that they formed the new substances we see.
