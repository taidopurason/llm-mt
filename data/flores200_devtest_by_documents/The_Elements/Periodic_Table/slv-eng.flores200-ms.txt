People have known basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, since antiquity, since all of them in their original form can be found in nature and can be extracted fairly easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle formulated the theory that everything consists of a mixture of four elements. These are soil, water, air and fire.
Basically, there were more four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he claimed to change into new substances and form what we see.
