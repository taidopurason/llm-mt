Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be relatively easily mined using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle thought that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These elements were earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized that they turn into new substances that make up what we see.
