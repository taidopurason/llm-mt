People have felt the basic elements of chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, since antiquity, as they can naturally be found in nature and are relatively easy to minimize with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle assumed that everything was made up of one or more of the four elements mixtures.They were land, water, air and fire.
It was more like four aggregates (in the same order) - solid, liquid, gaseous and plasing - although it also speculated that they form new substances we see.
