People know basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, from antiquity, since everything from them can be found in nature in the original form and can be quite easy to dig with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle designed the theory that everything consisted of a mix of four elements.These are earth, water, air and fire.
Basically, there were more four conditions of substances (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he claimed to turn into new substances and form what we see.
