A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
