Although Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha teachings, it also looks at the Mahayan path of love and numerous techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is, in principle, very simple.It consists of yoga kundalini, meditation and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini yoga with yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations enables the awakening of the energy of kundalini (enlightenment energy).
Central Tibetan meditation is a divine yoga.The visualization of different deities cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates enlightened consciousness.
