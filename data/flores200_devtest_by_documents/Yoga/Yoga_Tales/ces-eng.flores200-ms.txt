Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been extended to include the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, the principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple. They are Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centerpiece of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
