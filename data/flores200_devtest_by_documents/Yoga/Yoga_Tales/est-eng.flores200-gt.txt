Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but it was expanded to Mahayana's love path and several Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple.This includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and all -encompassing love.
Yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations are awakened by Kundalini yoga Kundalini energy (lighting energy).
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deities.Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and light consciousness is created.
