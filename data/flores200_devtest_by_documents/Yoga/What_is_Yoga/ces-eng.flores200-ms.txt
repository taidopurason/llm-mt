The degree of inner peace of a person corresponds to the opposite of the degree of tension in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more good the life force brings. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment can be attained by anyone. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
