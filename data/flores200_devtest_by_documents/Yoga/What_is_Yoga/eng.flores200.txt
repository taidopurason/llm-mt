The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates oppositely to the amount of tension in oneâ€™s body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
