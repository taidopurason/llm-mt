The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and soul.
The less the tension, the more positive is the vitality present. It is possible for every human being to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to reaching this goal is tension and negativity.
