The degree of inner peace of a person corresponds to the opposite of the degree of tension in his body and spirit.
The less the tension, the more good the life force brings. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment can be achieved by everyone. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tensions and negativity.
