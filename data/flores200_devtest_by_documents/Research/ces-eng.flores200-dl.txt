The work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team was looking for a phenomenon caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force on the Earth, causing the tides of the sea to ebb and flow, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is in a kind of "halo" around the galaxy, made up of lots of small particles.
