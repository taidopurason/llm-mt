The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team searched for a phenomenon that would be caused by a tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark mass of the Milky Way.
Like the moon, it acts on the ground and causes the tides of the sea level, the Milky Way has a force on the shooter's galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects another dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory says most of the dark matter in the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of "halo" and consists of many small particles.
