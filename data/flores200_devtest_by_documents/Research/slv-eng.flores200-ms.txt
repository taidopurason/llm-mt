The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observation of the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect the team wanted to achieve would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way forces forces the constellation Sagittarius to influence.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter acts similarly to normal matter on another dark matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is thought to linger around it in the form of a ring made up of many small particles.
