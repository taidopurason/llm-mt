Gold can be shaped into many different forms. It is possible to roll it into tiny forms.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and knitted. It can also be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be flattened very thin and attached to other metals. Because it can be so thinly flattened, it was sometimes used to decorate hand paintings in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
