Gold can be designed into many different shapes.It can be laid into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and knit.It may also be forged or rolled into the leaves.
It may be very thin and attached to other metals.Because it can be so thinly flattened, it was sometimes used to decorate hand paintings in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
