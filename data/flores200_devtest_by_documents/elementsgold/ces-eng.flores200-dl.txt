Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into miniature pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be bent and braided. It can be melted or pressed into slices.
It can be worked to considerable thinness and attached to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was often used to embellish hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
