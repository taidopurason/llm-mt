Of the Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza remains today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several major pyramid structures built to commemorate the late pharaoh.
On the Giza plateau, or 'Giza necropolis' in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of Khufu's wives and family members.
