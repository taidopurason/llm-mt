The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honour of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created as a tribute to Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
