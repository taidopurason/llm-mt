The Cheops pyramid is the only one of the seven world mansions to have survived to the present day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many giant pyramid structures built in honour of the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or 'Giza Necropolis', in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour Khufu's wives and family members.
