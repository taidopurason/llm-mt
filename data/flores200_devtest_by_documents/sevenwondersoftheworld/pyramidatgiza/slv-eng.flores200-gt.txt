Of the seven wonders, only a large pyramid in Giza is preserved today.
A large pyramid built by the Egyptians in the third century BC.n.Å ., is one of the many larger pyramid structures built to commemorate the deceased Pharaoh.
There are several pyramids on the Giza Plateau or in the "Necropolis in Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead (the largest of which is a large pyramid), smaller tombs, temples and a large sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Kufu, and many smaller pyramids, and the tombs and temples were built in honor of Kufu women and family members.
