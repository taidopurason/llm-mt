Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they have the opportunity, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of the animals an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, where they can tell which way they have moved on the ground by sniffing.
They can see very well at night due to their night vision and can move very quietly. Ocelots hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
