Ozelots feed on small animals.If they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds.Almost all the animals hunted by Ozelot are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that Ozelots pursue and seek animals for food (prey) with the help of smell, as they smell where they have lingered on the ground.
Due to night vision, they can see very well at night and also move inaudibly.Ozelotes are preying so that they first blend with their surroundings and then jump to prey.
