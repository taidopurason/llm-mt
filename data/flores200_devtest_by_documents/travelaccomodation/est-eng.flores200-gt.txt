Booking in advance gives the passenger peace of mind that he or she has a sleeping place when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can find other accommodation options, such as campgrounds, through the travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport from the airport/airport or even flight and hotel combined packages.
They can also keep your booking if you want to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (eg visa).
Any changes and applications should first be discussed with the tour operator not directly with the hotel.
