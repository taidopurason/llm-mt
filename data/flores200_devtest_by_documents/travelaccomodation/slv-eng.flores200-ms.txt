By booking in advance, the traveler guarantees that he will have somewhere to sleep when he comes to the selected destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with certain hotels, but you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfer, and even shared air and hotel packages.
They may also withhold your reservation if you need to consider an offer or obtain additional documents for your destination destination (e.g. visa).
However, all adjustments and wishes must first be communicated to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
