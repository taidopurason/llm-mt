With advance booking, the traveler ensures that he or she has to sleep when the selected destination occurs.
Travel agents often have contracts with certain hotels, but you can book other forms of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, and even joint packages of air travel and hotel.
They can also retain your reservation if you need to consider your offer or obtain additional documents for your target destination (eg visa).
However, all adjustments and wishes must first be communicated to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
