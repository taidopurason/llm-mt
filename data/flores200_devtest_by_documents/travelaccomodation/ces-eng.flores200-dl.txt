Booking accommodation in advance gives the traveller the certainty of having a place to stay at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it is also possible to book other forms of accommodation such as camping through them.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers or even combined airfare and hotel packages.
They can also hold your booking if you need time to think about it or to arrange other documents for the destination (e.g. a visa).
Any adjustments or requests should be directed to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
