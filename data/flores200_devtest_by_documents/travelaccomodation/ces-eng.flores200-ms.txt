Booking accommodation in advance gives the traveller the certainty that he will have a place to stay at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but they can also be used to book other forms of accommodation such as camping sites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined airfare and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think or to arrange additional documents for the destination (e.g. visa).
Any modifications or requests should first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel's address.
