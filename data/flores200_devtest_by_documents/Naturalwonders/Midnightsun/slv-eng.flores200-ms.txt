If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
You will be offered a good opportunity to see the aurora because during that period darkness is more or less throughout the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and most of the time there are no problems with light pollution, you will also be able to admire the stars.
