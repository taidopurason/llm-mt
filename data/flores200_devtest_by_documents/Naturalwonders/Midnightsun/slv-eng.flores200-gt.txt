If you go to Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience a polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
You will be offered a good opportunity to see the polar glow, as it is more or less all day at that time.
Because areas are rarely populated and mostly no problems with light pollution, you will also be able to admire the stars.
