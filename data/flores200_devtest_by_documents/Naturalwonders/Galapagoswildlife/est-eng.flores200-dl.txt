All the animals that originally arrived on the island arrived by swimming, flying or hovering.
Because of the long distance to the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, which is why giant tortoises are the main herbivores on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans first arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
