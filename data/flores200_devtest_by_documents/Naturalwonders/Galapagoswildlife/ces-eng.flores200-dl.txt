All the animals that originally arrived on the islands have swum there, flown there, or been carried there by wind or sea currents.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to cover this distance and the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man, many mammals have been brought to the Galapagos including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
