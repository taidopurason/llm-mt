All the animals that originally arrived on the island arrived here by swimming, flying or floating.
Since there is a long distance to the mainland, mammals could not undertake this journey, which is why giant turtles are the main herbivores in the Galapagos Islands.
Since man reached the Galapagos, many mammals have been brought there, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
