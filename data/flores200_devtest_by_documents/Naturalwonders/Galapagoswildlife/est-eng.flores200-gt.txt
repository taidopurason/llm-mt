All the animals that originally arrived on the island came here while swimming, flying or floating.
As the mainland is a long country, mammals could not take this journey, so giant turtles are the main herbivores on the galapagos islands.
Since the man reached the galapagos, many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs, have been brought there.
