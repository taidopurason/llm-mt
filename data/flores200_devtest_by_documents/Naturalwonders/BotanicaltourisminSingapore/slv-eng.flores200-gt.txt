Singapore is generally a very safe place and you can easily orient yourself in it, and after arrival you can buy almost anything.
In the "hot tropical belt", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to face the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which happens rarely).
