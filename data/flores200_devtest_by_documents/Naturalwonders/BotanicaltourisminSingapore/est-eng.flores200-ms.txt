Singapore is generally a very safe place to be, and it is very easy to navigate and you can buy almost anything from there after arrival.
But being located just a few degrees north of the equator in the so-called high latitudes of the tropics, you will have to cope with both heat (all the time) and strong solar radiation (if the sky is clear, less often).
