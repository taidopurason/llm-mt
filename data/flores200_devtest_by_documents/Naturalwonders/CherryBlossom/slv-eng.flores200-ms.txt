Cherry blossom spotting, or hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept came from China, where Japanese apricots were the most common choice of flowers.
In Japan, the first parties under the cherries were hosted by the emperor and arranged for himself and the rest of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
