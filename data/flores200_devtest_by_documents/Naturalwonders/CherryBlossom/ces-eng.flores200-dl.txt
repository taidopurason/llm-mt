The sighting of cherry blossoms known as hanami has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were a popular flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the emperor only for him and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
