Observing cherry flowers or hanami has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept came from China, where Japanese apricots were the most common choice of flowers.
In Japan, the first parties under the cherries were hosted by the emperor, and organized them for himself and for other members of aristocracy at the imperial court.
