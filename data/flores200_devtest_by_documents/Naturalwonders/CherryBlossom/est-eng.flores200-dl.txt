Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea originated in China, where plum blossoms were the flowers of choice.
The first cherry blossom feasts in Japan were hosted by the Emperor and were exclusively for him and other aristocrats of the Imperial court.
