Observation of cherry flowers known as Hanami has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China, where plum flowers were a popular flower.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry flowers were organized by the Emperor only for him and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
