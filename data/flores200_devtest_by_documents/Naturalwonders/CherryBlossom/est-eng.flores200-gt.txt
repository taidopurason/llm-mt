Watching cherry blossoms, called Hanam, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea comes from China, where the chosen flowers were plum flowers.
The first cherry tree parties were hosted by the emperor in Japan and were intended only for him and other aristocrats from the emperor's court.
