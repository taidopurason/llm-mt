Lions are the most sociable cats and live in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three related males and up to thirty females and cubs.
As a large family of sisters and daughters, the females are usually closely related to each other.
A pride of lions behaves very much like a pride of wolves or dogs, animals that are strikingly similar in behaviour to lions (but not to other big cats) and also very deadly to their prey.
