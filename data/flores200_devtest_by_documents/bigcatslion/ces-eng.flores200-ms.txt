Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males along with up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related and represent a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
A lion pack behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
