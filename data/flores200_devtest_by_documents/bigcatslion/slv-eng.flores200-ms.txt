Lions are the most sociable cats and live in large groups called packets.
In the pack there are one to three males that are related, and up to thirty females and cubs.
As a large family of sisters and daughters, women are usually closely interconnected.
The packed lions behave very similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are strikingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other large cats), and also very deadly for their prey.
