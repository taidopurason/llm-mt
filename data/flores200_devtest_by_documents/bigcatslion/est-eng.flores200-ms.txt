Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups, perhaps praids.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and puppies.
Females are usually very closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
In many ways, lion herds behave like wolf and dog herds â€“ animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very lethal to their prey.
