Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups, or praids.
The herds consist of one to three adult male and up to thirty female and puppies.
Females are usually very closely linked, forming a family of large sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave in many ways like wolf and dog herds- animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very fatal to their prey animals.
