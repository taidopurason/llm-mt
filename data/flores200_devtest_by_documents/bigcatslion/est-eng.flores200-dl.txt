Lions are the most social of the Cossacks, living in large groups, or prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually very closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions behave much like wolves and dogs - animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
