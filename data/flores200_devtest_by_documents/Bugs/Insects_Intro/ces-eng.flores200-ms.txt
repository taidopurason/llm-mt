Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a greater choice of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Nowadays, they are the only insects that can not fold their wings, dragonflies and mayflies.
