Insects were the first animals to use air to move. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies much more easily and to find food and companions much more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them more opportunities to find small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are moths and millipedes.
