Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and more efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a greater variety of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
