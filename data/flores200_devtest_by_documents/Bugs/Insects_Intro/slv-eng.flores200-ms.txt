Insects were the first animals to take off. Due to their ability to fly, they more skillfully avoided enemies and more effectively searched for food and mating partners.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings along their body.
This allows them even more opportunities to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings against the body are dragonflies and one-day ones.
