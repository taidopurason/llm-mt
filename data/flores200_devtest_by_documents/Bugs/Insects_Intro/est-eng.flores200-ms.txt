Insects were the first animals that began to move with the help of air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies much more easily and find food, as well as a mate much more efficiently.
Most insects are able to fold their wings against the body.
This gives them more opportunities to find small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that are not able to turn their wings backwards are dragonflies and daylily.
