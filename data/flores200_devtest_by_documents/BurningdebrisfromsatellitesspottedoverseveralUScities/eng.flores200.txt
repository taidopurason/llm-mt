The satellites, both of which weighed in excess of 1,000 pounds, and traveling at approximately 17,500 miles per hour, collided 491 miles above the Earth.
Scientists say the explosion caused by the collision was massive.
They are still trying to determine just how large the crash was and how the Earth will be affected.
The United States Strategic Command of the U.S. Department of Defense office is tracking the debris.
The result of plotting analysis will be posted to a public website.
