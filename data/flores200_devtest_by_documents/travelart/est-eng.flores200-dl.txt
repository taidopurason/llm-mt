There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax administrations define antiques as goods that are more than 100 years old.
The definition varies from one geographical area to another, for example in places such as North America the age limit may be shorter than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be called antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced items.
