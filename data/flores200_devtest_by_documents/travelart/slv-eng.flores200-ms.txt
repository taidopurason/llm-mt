There is no universal definition defining which products are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies by geographical area, since in places like North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handicraft products could be classified as antique items, although they are younger than similar goods from serial production.
