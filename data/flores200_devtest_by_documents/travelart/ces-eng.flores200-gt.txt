There is no universal definition that produced items are antiques.Some tax agencies define as antiques of goods more than 100 years old.
This definition has geographical variations where, for example, the age limit in North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade objects can be classified as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass -produced goods.
