There is no universal definition of which products are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods that are more than 100 years old.
The definition varies depending on the geographical area, as in places like North America the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handicraft products could be defined as antiques even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
