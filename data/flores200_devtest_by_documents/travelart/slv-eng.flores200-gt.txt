A universal definition that would determine what products are antiques does not exist.Some tax agencies as antiques define goods over 100 years of age.
The definition differs depending on the geographical area, since in places such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Home crafts products could be defined as antique items, although they are younger as similar goods from serial production.
