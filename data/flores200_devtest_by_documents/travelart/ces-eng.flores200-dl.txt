There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as items more than 100 years old.
This definition has geographical variations, where, for example, the age limit in North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade items may be classified as antiques even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
