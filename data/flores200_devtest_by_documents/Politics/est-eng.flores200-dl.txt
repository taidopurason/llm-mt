Voting in France has traditionally been a technology-free experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed piece of paper with the name of the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voters' list.
The procedural rules of French electoral law are quite strictly formalised in the law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are in the box at the start of the ballot and that no envelopes other than those duly counted and placed there by eligible voters are added.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision and following specific instructions.
