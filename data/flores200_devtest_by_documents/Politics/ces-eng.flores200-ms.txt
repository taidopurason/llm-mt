In France, voting traditionally takes place without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in a locker room and put a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope, listing the candidate they have elected.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter throws an envelope into the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
The French electoral law contains quite a strict codification of the electoral process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there were no envelopes before voting began and that no envelopes other than those placed by counted and eligible voters were added.
Candidates can send representatives, who then witness the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.
