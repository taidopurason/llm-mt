In France, voting has traditionally been a technology-free experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put pre-printed paper in an envelope with the name of the selected candidate.
After officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and writes his signature on the voter list.
The procedural rules of the French electoral law are quite strictly formalized in the laws.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and monitors can witness that there are no envelopes in the box at the beginning of voting and no envelopes other than those properly counted and added by eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe any part of the process. In the evening, the voices are counted by strictly supervised volunteers who follow specific instructions.
