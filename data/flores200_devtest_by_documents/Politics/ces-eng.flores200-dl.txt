Voting in France is traditionally conducted without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope, indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voters' list.
The French electoral law contains a fairly strict codification of the electoral process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes were present before voting began and that no envelopes other than those placed by counted and authorised voters were added.
Candidates may send representatives who then witness the entire process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.
