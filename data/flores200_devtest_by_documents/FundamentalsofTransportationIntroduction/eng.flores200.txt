Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you seldom hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling down.
Why do transportation systems engender such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
