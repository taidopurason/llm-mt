Using a ship to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional task of the navies was to ensure that the country retained the ability to move people and goods, while limiting the enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One such recent example, which is most noteworthy, was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. To help Britain, the Americans tried to bring men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German navy wanted to stop this kind of traffic, especially with U-submarines.
If the Allied forces failed, Germany would probably succeed in capturing Britain, like the rest of Europe.
