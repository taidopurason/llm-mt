Using ships for transport is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean.
Traditionally, the navy's job was to ensure the state's ability to transport people and goods, but the navy also had to prevent the enemy from transporting its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, then Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, like the rest of Europe.
