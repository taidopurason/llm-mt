Using a ship is by far the most effective way to transport a large number of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional task of the naval fleet consisted of ensuring the ability of the state to transport persons and goods, but at the same time the Navy should prevent the enemy to transport its own persons and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II.The Americans tried to move men and material through the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this operation, especially using submarines.
If the Allies failed, then Germany would probably conquer Britain, like the rest of Europe.
