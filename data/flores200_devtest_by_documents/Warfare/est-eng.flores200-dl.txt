The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the role of navies has been to ensure that a country is able to move people and goods, while at the same time preventing its enemies from moving their people and goods.
One of the most recent notable examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to invade Britain as it had the rest of Europe.
