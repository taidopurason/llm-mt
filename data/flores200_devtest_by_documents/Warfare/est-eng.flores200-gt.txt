The use of ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the naval forces has been to ensure that the state can move people and goods, while at the same time preventing enemies' ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War.The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, who mainly using the submarine, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain like the rest of Europe.
