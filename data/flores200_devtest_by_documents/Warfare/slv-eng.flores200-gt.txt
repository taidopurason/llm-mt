Using a ship for transporting goods is by far the most effective way to move a large number of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional Navy task was to ensure that the state maintains the ability to move people and goods while limiting the enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One such recent examples that is most noteworthy was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II.To help Britain, Americans tried to bring men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy wanted to stop such traffic with U-Podmarnica.
If the Allied forces failed, Germany would probably succeed in taking Britain just like the rest of Europe.
