Using ships for transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large amounts of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional task of the naval fleet was to ensure the ability of the state to transport people and goods, but at the same time the navy was also to prevent the enemy from transporting its own people and goods.
One of the most striking recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly with the help of submarines.
If the Allies failed, then Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain, like the rest of Europe.
