The use of ships to transport goods is arguably the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
Traditionally, navies have been tasked with ensuring that the state is able to move people and goods, and at the same time hindering the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mainly uses submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just like the rest of Europe.
