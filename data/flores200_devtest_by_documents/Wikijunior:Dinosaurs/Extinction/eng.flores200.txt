Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think about them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.
