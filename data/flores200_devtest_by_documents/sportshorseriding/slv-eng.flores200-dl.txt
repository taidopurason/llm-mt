The stirrups support the rider's feet and hang on each side of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but can also be a safety problem as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If the horse throws the rider off and the rider's foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse could drag the rider behind it if it escapes. To reduce this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety latches that allow the leather stirrup to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it back during a fall.
