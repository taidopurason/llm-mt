The stirrups, which hang on both sides of the saddle, serve as a support for the rider's legs.
They provide more stability to the rider, but can be associated with safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's legs getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but his foot gets caught in the stirrup and the horse starts to run, he can pull the rider behind him. A number of precautions can be taken to minimise this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a delicate sole that is quite narrow.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety rails that allow the stirrup belt to fall off the saddle when the falling rider pulls on it.
