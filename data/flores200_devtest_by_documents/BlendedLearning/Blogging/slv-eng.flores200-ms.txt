Blogs can help students improve their writing style. Although most students start blogging with superficial grammar and spelling, this tends to change with audience presence.
Because students can often be the most challenging audience, the blogger begins his efforts to improve writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to attract the interest of the audience inspires students to want to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages student engagement and commitment to learn, even when out of school.
Using blogs appropriately "can encourage students to think more analytically and critically; By constantly responding to online material, students can determine their position according to each other's records and form their own view on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
