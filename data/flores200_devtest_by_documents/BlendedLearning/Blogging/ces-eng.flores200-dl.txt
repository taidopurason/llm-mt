Even blogs can improve students' writing. Although their blogging is often marred by sloppy spelling in the beginning, the influence of other readers usually changes this.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blog writer tries to improve his or her writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be aware of the world around them." The need to pique the interest of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "allows students to improve their analytical and critical skills; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of other texts and articulate their perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
