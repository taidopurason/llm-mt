Excursions are an important part of any lesson. Teachers would often be happy to take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution by conducting virtual excursions. Students can see museum artifacts, visit the aquarium, or admire art right in the classroom.
Publishing an excursion report online is also a great way to think about the trip and share your experience with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, transforming the site every year, but the old versions stay online and serve as a memorial album.
