Excursions are a big part of any class. Often the teacher would like to take students to places where you cannot go by bus.
The technology offers a solution to this through virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire the beautiful arts, while sitting in class.
Sharing the tour virtually is also a great way to reflect on one trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. Every year, the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept for remembrance.
