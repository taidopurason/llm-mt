Excursions are an important part of every lesson. Teachers would often be happy to take pupils to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artefacts, visit an aquarium or admire art right in the classroom.
Posting a field trip report online is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create an annual website about their trip to the nation's capital, redesigning the site each year, but keeping the old versions online and serving as a keepsake scrapbook.
