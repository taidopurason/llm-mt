Excursions are a large part of each class.It would often be a good idea for a teacher to take students to places where you can't take the bus.
Technology provides a solution through virtual outings.Students can view the museum objects, visit the aquarium or admire the beautiful arts while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect one trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennet school of North Carolina design each year on the trip to the capital of their state.Every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept as a memory.
