Excursions are an essential part of every subject. The teacher would often like to take her students to places where bus travel is out of the question.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual excursions. Students can look at artifacts from the museum, visit the aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Virtual sharing of excursions is also a great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website each year about their trip to the state capital. Every year they redesign the site, but the old versions remain online and serve as an album.
