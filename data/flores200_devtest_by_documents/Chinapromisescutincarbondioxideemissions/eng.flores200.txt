"We will endeavour to cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by a notable margin by 2020 from the 2005 level," Hu said.
He did not set a figure for the cuts, saying they will be made based on China's economic output.
Hu encouraged developing countries "to avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later."
He added that "they should not, however, be asked to take on obligations that go beyond their development stage, responsibility and capabilities."
