About 3 minutes after liftoff, the dash cam showed a number of pieces of insulating foam that had separated from the fuel tank.
However, they are not expected to cause any damage to the shuttle.
NASA's chief of the rocket program, N. Wayne Hale Jr., said the foam fell off "after a key period of time."
