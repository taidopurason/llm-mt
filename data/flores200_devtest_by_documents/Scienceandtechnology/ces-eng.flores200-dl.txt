Approximately 3 minutes after take-off, the on-board camera showed a number of pieces of insulation foam that had separated from the fuel tank.
However, they are not believed to have caused any damage to the shuttle.
NASA rocket program chief N. Wayne Hale Jr. said the foam fell off "after the key time examined."
