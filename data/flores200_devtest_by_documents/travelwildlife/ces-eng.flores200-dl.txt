Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and for many tourists it is the highlight of the whole trip.
The term safari in the familiar sense refers to overland travel to view Africa's stunning wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to vehicles, and standard equipment will allow a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can better observe them with binoculars.
A tourist safari consists of a walking tour lasting several hours to several days.
