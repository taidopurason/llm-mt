Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
In everyday usage, the term safari means an overland trip to see African wildlife, mainly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and can be seen with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards can be shy, so binoculars will help you see them better.
A walking safari (also called a 'bush walk', 'walking safari' or 'walking safari') refers to a trek that can last from a few hours to a few days.
