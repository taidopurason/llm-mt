Africa's biggest tourist attraction is probably safaris, which are the highlight of the trip for many guests.
The popularly used term "safari" refers to land trips with the aim of discovering African wildlife, especially savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to cars, and standard equipment is enough to observe them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes macaws and are easier to see with binoculars.
"A safari walk (in English it is still referred to as 'bush walk', ''hiking safari'' or ''footing') consists of a hike that is either a couple of hours or several days long."
