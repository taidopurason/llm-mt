Safarias are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The concept of safari in everyday use means a land trip where we see African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are often approaching cars and can be viewed well with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes timid, so you will be easier to see them with binoculars.
On foot safari (also called a "walk on the bush", "hiking safari" or "walking") marks a hike that can last from a few hours to a few days.
