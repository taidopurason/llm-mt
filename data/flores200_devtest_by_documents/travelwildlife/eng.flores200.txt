Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourism draw in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to overland travel to view the stunning African wildlife, particularly on savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach closely to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or going "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
