Safaris are arguably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in everyday use means land travel, where we look at African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, and they can be viewed well using standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid, so you'll find it easier to see them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "thicket walk," "hiking safari," or "walking") marks a hike that can take anywhere from a few hours to several days.
