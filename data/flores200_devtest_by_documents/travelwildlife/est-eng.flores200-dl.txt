Africa's biggest tourist attraction is probably safaris, which are the highlight of many visitors' trips.
The popular term 'safari' refers to overland trips to discover African wildlife, especially savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to the cars and standard equipment is sufficient to observe them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and easier to see with binoculars.
"A safari walk (also referred to as a 'bush walk', 'hiking safari' or 'footing') consists of a hike of either a few hours or several days."
