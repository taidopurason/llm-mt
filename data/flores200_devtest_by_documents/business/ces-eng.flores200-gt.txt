Jamie Siminoff, Executive Director of Ring, previously said that his company was founded after he did not hear the sound of the door bell in his garage.
He stated that he created the door bell via WiFi.
Siminoff said the sale increased after his appearance in the Shark Episode in 2013, where the management of the program refused to finance the startup.
At the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on the QVC teleshopping channel.
Ring also resolved a lawsuit with a competitive security company ADT Corporation.
