Jamie Siminoff, Ring's CEO, previously said his company was founded after he couldn't hear the sound of the doorbell in his garage workshop.
He said he created the doorbell over WiFi.
Siminoff said sales increased after his appearance on an episode of Shark Tank in 2013, where the show's executives refused to fund the startup.
In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on QVC's teleshopping channel.
Ring also settled a lawsuit with rival security firm ADT Corporation.
