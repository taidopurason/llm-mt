Earlier, Jamie Siminoff, Ring's CEO, remarked that the company started when he didn't hear the doorbell in his garage workshop.
He said he had made a wireless doorbell.
Siminoff said that sales soared after he appeared on an episode of Shark Tank in 2013, where the show's panel refused to fund the start-up.
In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on the sales TV channel QVC.
Ring also negotiated a settlement with rival security company ADT Corporation.
