A former Filipino policeman has kept Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an aged lady as she needed the lavatory. Mendoza was gunned down.
