The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, fall under the auspices of several nations and have the most bases, of which 16 were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are Livingston Island and the Island of Deception, on which the flooded caldera of the still active volcano serves as a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a province south of the peninsula surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge here into a plateau, then re-emerge as the 360km Ellsworth Mountain Range, split by a Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinelese Mountain Range is the highest mountain range in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising 4892 m high.
