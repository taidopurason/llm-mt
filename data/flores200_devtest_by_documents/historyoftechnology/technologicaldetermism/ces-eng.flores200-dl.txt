Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technology push or technological imperative, or the belief that human destiny is governed by an all-pervasive logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes well beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has an "influence" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that when motor cars appear, this will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
But the national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is also leading to an increase in road accidents, causing the medical profession to invent new techniques to repair damaged bodies.
