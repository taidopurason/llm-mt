Technological determinism is a concept that includes a variety of ideas in practice, from technological thrust or technological imperative to the firm conviction that human fate is led by the logic of science and its manifestation of technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the technology itself follows a path that is largely culturally or politically influenced by the technology, and that technology itself has an impact on society that is more internal than socially caused.
For example, the existence of motor vehicles certainly leads to road development.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, which is why they seek to develop new production methods to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to the number of more accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the invention of the techniques of repairing new bodies in health care.
