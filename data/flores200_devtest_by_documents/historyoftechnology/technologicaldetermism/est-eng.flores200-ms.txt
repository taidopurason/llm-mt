Technological determinism is a concept that includes in practice a variety of ideas, ranging from technological thrust or technological imperative to the firm belief that the fate of a person is governed by the logic associated with the regularities of science and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely culturally or politically influenced, and that technology itself has an impact on a society that is internalized rather than socially driven.
For example, it can be said that the presence of motor vehicles certainly dictates the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically feasible for only a few cars, which is why attempts are being made to develop new production methods in order to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques for repairing damaged bodies in health care.
