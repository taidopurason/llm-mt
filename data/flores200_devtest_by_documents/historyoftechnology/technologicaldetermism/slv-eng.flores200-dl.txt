Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological aspiration or technological necessity to the idea that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their implementation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share the same general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology consequently produces "effects" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that as the car evolves, so will the roads.
However, a national road network cannot be economically justified for just a few cars, so new ways of manufacturing are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the care of injured bodies.
