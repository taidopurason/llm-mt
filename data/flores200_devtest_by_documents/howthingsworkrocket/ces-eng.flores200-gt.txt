If you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use satellite to call.
The satellite in space receives a call and then reflects its signal almost immediately back down.
The satellite was brought into space by a rocket.Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts the light and field of view.
A large missile is required to bring a satellite or telescope into space, which measures over 100 feet.
