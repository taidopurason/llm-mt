When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts the light and the view.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket that is more than 100 feet high.
