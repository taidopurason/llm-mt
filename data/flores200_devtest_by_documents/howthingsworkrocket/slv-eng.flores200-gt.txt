When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then bounces it back down.
The satellite was sent to space by a rocket.Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
It takes a huge rocket over 100 feet to transport a satellite or telescope to space.
