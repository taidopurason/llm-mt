When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
In space, the satellite receives a call and then bounces it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
Transporting a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket over 100 feet in size.
