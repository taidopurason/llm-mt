When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite to make a call.
A satellite in space receives a call and then its signal bounces back down almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because Earth's atmosphere partially distorts our light and field of view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, it takes a large rocket that measures over 100 feet.
