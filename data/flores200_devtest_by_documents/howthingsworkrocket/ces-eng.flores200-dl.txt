If you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite to make the call.
A satellite in space receives the call and then bounces its signal back down almost immediately.
The satellite was carried into space by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because Earth's atmosphere partially distorts our light and field of view.
It takes a large rocket measuring over 100 feet to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
