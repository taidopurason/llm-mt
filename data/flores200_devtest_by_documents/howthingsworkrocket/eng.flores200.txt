When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space gets the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earthâ€™s atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
It takes a giant rocket over a 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
