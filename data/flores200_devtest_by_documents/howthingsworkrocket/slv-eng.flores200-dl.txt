When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and then bounces it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
It takes a huge rocket, more than 100 feet high, to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
