If you are calling someone thousands of miles away, you are using satellite.
A satellite in space picks up the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts the light and the view a little.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket more than 100 feet high.
