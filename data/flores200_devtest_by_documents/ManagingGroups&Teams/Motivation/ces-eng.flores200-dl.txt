Content theories focus on finding out what people can relate to or are close to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they adopt as they grow up.
These theories are concerned with what motivates certain people to want what they do and what in their environment makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
