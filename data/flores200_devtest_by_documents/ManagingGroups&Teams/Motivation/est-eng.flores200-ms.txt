Theories of achievement needs seek to understand what drives people to act and what they like.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted as they mature into adulthood.
These theories deal with what makes certain people want the things they do and what environmental factors make them do certain things or not.
The two most popular need-based theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
