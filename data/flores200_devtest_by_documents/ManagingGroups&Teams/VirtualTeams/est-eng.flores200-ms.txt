Virtual teams are subject to the same high demands as regular teams, but there are still minor differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their direct real group.
They usually have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet according to different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The so-called invisible team is the administrative team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
