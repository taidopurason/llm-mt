Virtual teams are subject to the same high standards as regular teams, but there are still some minor differences.
Virtual team members are often the point of contact for their real team.
They usually have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The so-called invisible team is an administrative team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
