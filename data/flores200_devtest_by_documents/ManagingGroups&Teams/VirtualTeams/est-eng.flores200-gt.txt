Virtual teams are subject to the same high demands as regular teams, but there are still small differences.
Virtual team members are often the contact point of their direct real group.
They usually have more autonomy than conventional crew members, as their teams can meet according to different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and Lafasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The so -called invisible team is an administrative team to whom each member reports.The invisible team sets standards for each member.
