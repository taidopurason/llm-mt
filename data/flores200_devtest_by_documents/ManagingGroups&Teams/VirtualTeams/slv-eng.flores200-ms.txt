Virtual teams strive for the same standards of excellence as conventional groups, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more freedom than ordinary team members, as their teams have to adapt to multiple time zones, something their local leadership sometimes has no ear for.
Another characteristic component of the virtual group is the presence of a real "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989:109).
An "Invisible Team" is a management team reported by individual members. The invisible team sets standards for each member individually.
