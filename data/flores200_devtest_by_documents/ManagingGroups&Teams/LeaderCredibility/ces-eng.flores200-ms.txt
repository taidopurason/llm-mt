Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead their former peer colleagues. At one end of the spectrum, there is an effort to remain "one of them" (or one of them).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you change beyond recognition and feel that you have to change everything the team does and do it your way.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
