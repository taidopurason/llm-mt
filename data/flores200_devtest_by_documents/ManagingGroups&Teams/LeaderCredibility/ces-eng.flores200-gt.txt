Generally speaking, two types of behavior may occur when managers begin to lead their former colleagues - peers.At one end of the spectrum is an effort to stay "one of them" (or one of them).
This type of manager has difficulty taking unpopular decisions, introducing disciplinary measures, performance evaluation, allocating responsibility and leading people to responsibility.
At the other end of the spectrum, one changes beyond recognition and feels that he has to change everything the team does and do it by himself.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in disagreement between the leaders and the rest of the team.
