When directors start to lead their former colleagues, it is generally considered that they can begin to behave in one of two ways.On the one hand, an effort is present to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
Such a leader has a hard time making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, assessing workers' efficiency, assigning tasks and requiring responsibility for errors.
On the other hand, we can turn into an unrecognizable individual who thinks that he has to change everything that the team has done and to draw on his own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the group.
Such behavior often creates gaps between leaders and other team members.
