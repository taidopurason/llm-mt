When CEOs begin to lead their former colleagues, it is generally accepted that they can begin to behave in one of two ways. On the one hand, there is an effort to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
Such a manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary measures, evaluate the efficiency of workers, assign tasks and hold them accountable for the mistakes made.
On the other hand, we can turn into an unrecognizable individual who thinks he needs to change everything the team has done and chart the course in his own way.
After all, the management is primarily responsible for the success and failure of the team.
As a result of this behavior, gaps are often created between leaders and the rest of the team.
