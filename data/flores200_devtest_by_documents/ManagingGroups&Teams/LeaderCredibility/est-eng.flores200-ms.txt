When managers begin to lead their former peers, it can generally provoke dual behaviors. One extreme of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the boys (or girls)".
It is difficult for this type of manager to make unpopular decisions, call to order, make assessments, set responsibilities and assign responsibility to employees.
At the other end of the spectrum is a person who changes beyond recognition, feeling that he needs to change everything the team has done so far and make it his own.
In the end, the manager is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between managers and the rest of the team.
