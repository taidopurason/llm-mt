Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
