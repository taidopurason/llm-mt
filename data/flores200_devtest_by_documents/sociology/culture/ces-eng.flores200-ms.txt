Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that make a subculture different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of the subculture often express their membership through strong and symbolic use of a style that includes dress, behavior, and slang.
