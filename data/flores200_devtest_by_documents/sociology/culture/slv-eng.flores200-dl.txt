Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by societal norms and allow them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can differ in age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their belonging through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and argot.
