Subcultures unite individuals with similar ideas, who feel that social standards do not apply to them, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguishable by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
Characteristics that allow to distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a mixture of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through the use of a special and symbolic style, which includes fashion, behavioral manners, and argoo.
