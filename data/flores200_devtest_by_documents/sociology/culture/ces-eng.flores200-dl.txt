Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalised by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes dress, behavior, and slang.
