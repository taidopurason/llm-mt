Subcultures bring together like-minded people who seem ignored by social standards and allow them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures may vary by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that make the subculture recognizable can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of the subculture often show their affiliation through a recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behaviour and argo.
