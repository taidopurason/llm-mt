Self -multi -agriculture is agriculture performed for production of only a lot of food that will meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Substantial agriculture is a simple, often organic system using the original seed in a given ecoregion combined with crops alternation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In history, most farmers dealt with self -polling agriculture, which is still happening in many developing countries.
