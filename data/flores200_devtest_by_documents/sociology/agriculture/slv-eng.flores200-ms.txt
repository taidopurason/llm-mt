Subsistence agriculture is a term used for agriculture in order to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of a farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecological system that uses saved seeds originating from the same organic region combined with crop rotation or another simple technique to ensure the best harvest.
In the past, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
