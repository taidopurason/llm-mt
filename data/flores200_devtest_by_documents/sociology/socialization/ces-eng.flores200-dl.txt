One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "wolf" children. Some wolf children have been incarcerated for long periods of time (usually by their own parents), and in some cases have lived abandoned because their parents rejected them due to their severe mental or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma, after which they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, while some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised completely by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits almost identical behaviors (within physical limits) to the caring animal in question, such as fear or inattention to humans.
