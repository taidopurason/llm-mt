One of the ways that are most commonly used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to come from some unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults during their growing up due to neglect, unfortunate circumstances or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "wolf" or wild children.Some wolf children were closed (usually their parents);In some cases, such a form of child abuse was the result of rejection of a child's severe mental or physical disability by their parents.
Before they were abandoned or escaped, wild children may have been subject to serious abuse or traumas in childhood.
Others are supposed to raise animals;For some, they say they lived in the wild themselves.
When wild children fully raise inhuman animals, their behavior (within physical restrictions) is almost exactly the same as the behavior of animals-suppliers, such as fear or indifference to humans.
