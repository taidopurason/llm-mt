One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialisation is to draw attention to the few unfortunate cases where adults failed to socialise children growing up because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called savages or savages. People (often their parents) have held on to feral children; in some cases, parents abandoned the child because of severe intellectual or physical deprivation.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived on their own in the wild.
If a child is raised entirely by an animal, the wild child will behave (within physical limits) almost exactly like the animal that raised it, for example by being afraid of or indifferent to humans.
