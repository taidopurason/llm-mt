One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, have not been socialized by adults growing up.
Such babies are called "wolf" children. Some wolf children were imprisoned for long periods of time (usually imprisoned by their own parents), in some cases they lived abandoned because their parents rejected them because of their severe mental or physical disabilities.
Wild children could experience severe abuse or trauma and then be abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, while some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully raised by non-human animals, a wild child exhibits almost the same behavior (within physical capabilities) as the caring animal, such as its fear or disregard for humans.
