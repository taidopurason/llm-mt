One of the ways most often used to illustrate the importance of socialisation is to draw on a few unfortunate examples of children who were not socialised by adults when growing up, either because of neglect, unfortunate circumstances or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "wolf" or feral children. Some wolf children have been imprisoned by people (usually their parents); this form of child abuse has in some cases been the result of parental rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disabilities.
Before they were abandoned or escaped, feral children may have been subjected to severe abuse or trauma during their childhood.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild themselves.
When wild children are raised completely by non-human animals, their behaviour (within physical limits) is almost identical to that of their guardian animals, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
