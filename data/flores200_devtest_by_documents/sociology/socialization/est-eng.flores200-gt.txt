One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to pay attention to the few unfortunate cases where adults did not socialize children due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse during the growth of children.
Such children are called wild or wild.People (often their parents) have held wild children;In some cases, parents abandoned the child due to serious intellectual or physical deficiency.
Wild children could experience acute abuse or trauma before rejection or run away.
Others were allegedly raised by animals, and some are said to have lived on their own in the wild.
When a child is completely raised by an animal, a wild child (within the physical boundaries) behaves completely as an animal that raised it, for example, is afraid of or indifferent to them.
