One of the ways most commonly used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to proceed from some unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during the growing up due to neglect, unfortunate circumstances or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "wolf" or wild children. Some wolf children have been imprisoned by people (usually their parents); This form of child abuse was in some cases the result of parental rejection of the child's severe mental or physical handicap.
Before being abandoned or escaped, wild children may have been subjected to severe abuse or trauma during their childhood.
Others are supposed to raise animals; Some say that they themselves lived in the wild.
When wild children are fully raised by non-human animals, their behavior (within physical limits) is almost identical to that of caregivers, such as fear or indifference to humans.
