One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to pay attention to those few unfortunate cases in which adults did not socialize children during their upbringing due to neglect, adversity, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called feral or wild. People (often their parents) have held wild children; In some cases, the child was abandoned by parents due to severe intellectual or physical deprivation.
Wild children may have experienced acute abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others were allegedly bred by animals, some are said to have lived on their own in the wild.
When a child is fully raised by an animal, a wild child (within physical limits) behaves almost completely like an animal that raised him, for example, he is afraid of people or is indifferent to them.
