To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by most accounts ends around 1500.
