To understand the Knights Templar, we need to understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The period in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages and was a period in European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which are conventionally considered to have ended in 1500.
