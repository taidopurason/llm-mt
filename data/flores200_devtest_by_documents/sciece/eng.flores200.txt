This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides details fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also grants insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers inferred the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development that these other features.
The feathers' structure suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not a chick's down.

They found the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star with respect to magnetic reversals.
The 802.11n standard operates on both the 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.
This will allow it to be backwards compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided that the base station has dual radios.
The speeds of 802.11n are substantially faster than that of its predecessors with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600Mbit/s.
