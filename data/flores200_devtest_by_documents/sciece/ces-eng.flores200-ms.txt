This fact not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (this theory is already widespread), but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, for example, about color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotene-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a very developed spine called rachis, but have other features - rays and hooks - the researchers concluded that rachis probably evolved later than these other traits.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature control or demonstration.  Scientists assume that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not a cub.
Scientists assume that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, it represents a pattern of plumage of an adult animal, and not the feathers of a cub.
They found that the Sun works on the same basic principle as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system is apparently determined by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
Based on the luminosity and rotation, the Rossby number of the star, which is related to the plasma flux, is determined.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic turnover.
The 802.11n standard operates at both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.
This will allow backward compatibility with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g standards, provided that the base station has a dual transmitter.
802.11n speeds are significantly higher than its predecessors with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbit/s.
