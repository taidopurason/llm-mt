This confirms the well-established theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, while also providing data that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on the upper side, and pastel or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
The find also offers insight into the development of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur pens do not have a well-developed sleeve called ribs, but they do have all the other properties of feathers — twigs and hooks — the researchers found that ribs are likely to evolve later in evolution than other traits.
From the structure of the pens, we can conclude that they were not used to escape, but to regulate temperature or showcase. Although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, according to the researchers, the sample suggests that it is the plumage of an adult specimen, and not a fluffy cub.

They found that the Sun works the same way as other stars: all the stars in the system are driven by their luminosity and rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and circulation are used together to determine Rossby's star number associated with plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is when it comes to replacing the magnetic poles.
The 802.11n standard operates at both a frequency of 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz.
For this reason, it will be backwards compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g standards if the base station has dual radio.
The speeds of the 802.11n standard are significantly higher than those of its predecessors, with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbit/s.
