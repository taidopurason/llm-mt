This confirms the well-established theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides information that fossils usually cannot, such as colour and three-dimensional distribution.
. Scientists say that the feathers of these animals were chestnut brown on the upper side and pastel or carotenoid coloured on the underside.
The find also offers insights into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have the well-developed quill called the rib, but have all the other features of feathers - twigs and hooks - the researchers concluded that the rib very likely developed later in evolution than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. Although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the researchers believe the pattern suggests that it is the feathers of an adult specimen, not the down of a juvenile.
Although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the researchers believe that the sample indicates that it is the feathers of an adult and not the down of a juvenile.
They found that the Sun works in the same way as other stars: all the stars in the system are driven by their own radiation and rotation, and nothing else.
The emission and rotation are used together to determine the star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic pole swapping.
The 802.11n standard operates at both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz.
This will make it backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, as long as the base station has dual radios.
802.11n speeds are significantly faster than its predecessors, with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbit/s.
