Aside from proving that at least some dinosaurs had feathers – already a widespread theory – it allows you to see details that are not usually seen in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to scientists, the plumage of the animal was chestnut-brown, and its underside was light or yellowish-red.
The find allows you to take a look at the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have an evolved feather called feather feathers, but they do have other parts of the feather — the nebulous base of the feather and feather — the researchers concluded that it was likely that the feather pod evolved evolutionarily later than the rest.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature control or demonstration. The researchers suggested that the specimen is an example of an adult plumage, not a chick's down, even though it is a young dinosaur's tail.
Scientists hypothesized that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult, and not the down of a chick.
They discovered that the Sun works on the same principles as other stars: it was discovered that the action of all stars in the system is guided by their brightness, rotation and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the number of the star Rossby, which is associated with the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the magnetic inversion.
Standard 802.11n operates at frequencies of 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz.
This allows for backward compatibility with standards 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided that the base station has two radios.
The speed of the 802.11n is significantly faster than that of its predecessors: its maximum theoretical performance is 600 Mbit/s.
