Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry ski, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually not involving alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter ones done in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as of a similar hiking route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than walking â€“ but only very seldom you will get the speeds of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack in groomed tracks.
