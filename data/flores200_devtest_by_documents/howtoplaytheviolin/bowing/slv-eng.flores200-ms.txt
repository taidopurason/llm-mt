The designation for "arch up" looks like the letter V, and for "arc down" - as a clip or square without the underside.
Up means you should start at the top of the arc and push it, down means you should start at the frog (that is, where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
Pulling the arc from above usually creates a softer sound, while pulling the arc from below is stronger and more decisive.
If you wish, you can use a pencil to outline your arch markings, but remember that printed arch markings are listed for music, so they must be taken into account otherwise.
