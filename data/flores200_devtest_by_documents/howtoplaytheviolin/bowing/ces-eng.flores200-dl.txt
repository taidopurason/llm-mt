The "loop up" mark looks like the letter V and the "loop down" mark looks like a paperclip or square that is missing the bottom side.
Up means you start at the toe and push on the loop, down means you start at the frog (where your hand holds the loop) and pull on the loop.
Moving up will generally produce a softer sound, while moving down is stronger and more penetrating.
You can write your own marks in pencil on the sheet, but keep in mind that the printed marks are there for a reason musically, so they should usually be followed.
