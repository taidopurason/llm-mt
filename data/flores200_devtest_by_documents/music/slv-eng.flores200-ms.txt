Sara Danius, Permanent Secretary of the Nobel Committee on Literature of the Swedish Academy, publicly announced Monday during a radio show on Sveriges Radio that a committee that could not directly inform Bob Dylan that he had won the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature had abandoned its efforts to find him.
Danius said, "We are doing nothing right now. I called his closest colleague and emailed him several emails, and I received very friendly replies. For now, this is definitely enough".
