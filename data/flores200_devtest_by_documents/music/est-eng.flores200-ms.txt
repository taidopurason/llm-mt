On Monday, Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee on Literature at the Swedish Academy, announced on Sveriges Radio's public radio show that since Bob Dylan had not been contacted to announce his victory in the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, the Swedish committee had stopped trying to get in touch with her.
Danius said, "We're not doing anything right now. We called and wrote to his closest collaborator and received very friendly answers. That's definitely enough for now."
