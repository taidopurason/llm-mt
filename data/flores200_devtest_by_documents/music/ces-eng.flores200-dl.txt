Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature at the Swedish Academy, announced publicly on Monday via a radio program on Sweden's Sveriges Radio that the committee is abandoning its efforts to contact Bob Dylan directly after he won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature.
Danius said, "Right now we're not doing anything. I have called and emailed his closest collaborator and have received very friendly responses. For now, that's definitely enough."
