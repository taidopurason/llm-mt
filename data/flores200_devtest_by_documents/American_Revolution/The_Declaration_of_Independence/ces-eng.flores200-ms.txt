After adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
Between 150 and 200 copies, which are now called "Dunlap Prints," were made overnight.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9. One of the copies arrived in London on August 10.
The oldest known surviving copies of the document are the so-called. Dunlap broadsides, or a total of 25 copies from Dunlap's printer. The original manuscript copy has not been preserved.
