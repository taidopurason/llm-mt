After it had been passed by Congress on July 4, a manuscript of the bill, signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the John Dunlap printing house a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, now known as Dunlap copies.
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8 at Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read aloud to his soldiers on July 9 in New York. A copy of it arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 copies made by Dunlap are the oldest surviving copies of the declaration. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
