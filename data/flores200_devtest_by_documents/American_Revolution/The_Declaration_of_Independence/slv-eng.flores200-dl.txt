After its adoption by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary of Congress, Charles Thomson, was sent a few streets away to John Dunlap's printing works.
Between 150 and 200 copies, known as "Dunlap's pamphlets", were produced during the night.
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon on 8 July in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
There are still 25 Dunlap pamphlets, which are believed to be the oldest surviving copies of this document, as the handwritten original has not survived.
