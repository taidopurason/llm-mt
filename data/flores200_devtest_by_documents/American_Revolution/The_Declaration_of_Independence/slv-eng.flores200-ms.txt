After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies known as "Dunlap leaflets" were produced.
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon on July 8 in the Independence Hall courtyard.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. One copy reached London on 10 August.
There are still 25 Leaflets of Dunlap, which are considered to be the oldest surviving copies of this document, as the handwritten original has not been preserved.
