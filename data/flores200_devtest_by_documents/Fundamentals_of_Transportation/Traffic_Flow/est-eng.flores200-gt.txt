A traffic flow is a study that looks at the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and interactions between them.
Unfortunately, exploring traffic flows is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100 % certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, so the traffic flows tend to be somewhat reasonably consistent and can be broadly mathematically presented.
To better describe the flow of traffic, connections between three main characteristics have been created: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These connections contribute to the design, design and operation of the driveway facilities.
