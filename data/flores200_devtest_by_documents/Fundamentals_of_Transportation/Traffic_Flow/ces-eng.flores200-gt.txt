Operation is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, exploring the flow of operation is difficult, because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with 100 % certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly in a certain range;Therefore, traffic usually has a reasonable consistency and can be approximately mathematically depicted.
In order to better represent the flow of the operation, relations between three main characteristics were determined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate transport facilities.
