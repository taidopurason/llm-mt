Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, examining the flow of traffic is difficult, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a certain range;  Therefore, the operation usually has some reasonable consistency and can be approximately mathematically depicted.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
