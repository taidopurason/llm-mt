The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult, since the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers is usually to some extent stable, so traffic flows are also established and can roughly be represented in mathematical form.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, relationships between the main three characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These proportions help in the planning, design and operation of roadways.
