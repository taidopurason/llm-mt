Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems cause complaints about everyday failures?Are transport engineers just incompetent?Or is there something more fundamental?
