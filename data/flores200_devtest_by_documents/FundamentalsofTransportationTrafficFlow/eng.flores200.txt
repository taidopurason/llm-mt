Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with one another.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one-hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic streams tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, design, and operations of roadway facilities.
