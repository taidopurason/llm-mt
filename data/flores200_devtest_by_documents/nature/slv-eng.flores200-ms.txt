After the dam was built in 1963, seasonal flooding, which swept sediment throughout the river, was halted.
This sediment was crucial for the emergence of sandy shores and beaches, which became a natural habitat for wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish became extinct, and two more became endangered, including humpback chub.
Although water levels will only rise by a few feet after the flood, authorities hope this will be enough to restore the undermined sandy shores along the river down.
No tsunami warning has been issued and, according to the Jakarta Geophysics Agency, a tsunami warning will not even be issued, as the earthquake has not reached the required magnitude of 6.5.
Although there was no risk of tsunamis, residents stirred alarm and began to leave their business premises and homes.
