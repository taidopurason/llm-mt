Following the position of the dam in 1963, seasonal floods were stopped, which would expand the sediment along the river.
These deposits were necessary to create sands and beaches that served as a natural habitat for wild animals.
As a result, two types of fish were extinct, and the other two, including Gily Arizona, are now in danger.
Although the water level rises only a few feet after the flood, officials hope that it is sufficient to restore the eroded sands below.
No warning against the Tsunami was issued, and according to the Geophysical Agency in Jakarta, no one will be issued, because the shocks did not reach the required intensity of 6.5 degrees.
Despite the fact that there was no threat of tsunami, the inhabitants began to panic and leave their shops and homes.
