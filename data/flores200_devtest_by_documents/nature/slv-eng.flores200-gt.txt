After being built in 1963, the seasonal floods that spread throughout the river were stopped.
This sediment was crucial for the formation of sandy shims and beaches that became a natural habitat for wildlife and plants.
As a result, two species of fish were extinct, and two more became threatened, including a humpback.
Although the water level will only rise for a few shoes after the flood, the authorities hope that this will be sufficient to restore the underpassed sandy shims along the river.
The warning about the tsunami was not issued and, according to the Geophysics Agency in Jakarta, a tsunami warning will not or issue, as the earthquake did not reach the required magnitude of 6.5.
Although there was no risk of tsunamis, the residents started a scare and began leaving their business premises and homes.
