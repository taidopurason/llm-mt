After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal flooding that spread sediment throughout the river was stopped.
This sediment was crucial for the creation of sandbanks and beaches, which have become a natural habitat for wildlife and plants.
As a result, two species of fish have become extinct and two more have become endangered, including the humpback chub.
Although the water level will only rise by a few feet after the flooding, authorities hope this will be enough to restore the eroded sandbanks along the river downstream.
No tsunami warning has been issued and, according to the Jakarta Geophysics Agency, no tsunami warning will be issued as the earthquake did not reach the required magnitude of 6.5.
Although there was no risk of tsunamis, residents were alarmed and began to leave their business premises and homes.
