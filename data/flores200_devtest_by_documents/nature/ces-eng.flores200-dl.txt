After the dam was built in 1963, seasonal flooding that would have spread sediment down the river was stopped.
These sediments were necessary to create sandbars and beaches that served as habitat for wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish became extinct and two others, including the Arizona gila, are now endangered.
Although the water level will only rise a few feet after the flooding, officials hope it will be enough to restore the eroded sandbars downstream.
No tsunami warning has been issued and none will be issued, according to the geophysical agency in Jakarta, because the tremors did not reach the required magnitude of 6.5.
Despite the absence of a tsunami threat, residents began to panic and abandon their shops and homes.
