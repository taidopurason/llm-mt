The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Uniforms are customary and co-workers call each other by surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, with an emphasis on team effort rather than individual achievement.
Employees often need to obtain the approval of their superiors before making any decision and must follow their superiors' instructions without question.
