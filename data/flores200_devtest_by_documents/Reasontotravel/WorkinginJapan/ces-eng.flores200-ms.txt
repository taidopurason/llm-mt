Japan's work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
A businessman's standard dress is a suit, and co-workers address each other by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is key, rather than praising individual achievements, group efforts are emphasized.
Workers must obtain the approval of supervisors for each of their decisions and are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without question.
