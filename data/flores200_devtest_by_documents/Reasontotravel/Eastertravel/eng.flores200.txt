There's a tradition to pass the Easter night awake at some exposed point to see the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with the congregations often breaking into celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
