It is a tradition to spend Easter night awake in some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it can also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter memorial services on Saturday nights during Easter weekend, with congregations often entering a midnight celebration to celebrate Christ's Resurrection.
