There is a tradition in which people wake up on Easter night in some exposed place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as easily be a pre-Christian celebration of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday night during Easter weekend, when the congregation often breaks out into celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
