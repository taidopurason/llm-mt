According to tradition, Easter should be fled at some exposed place and sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but this can also be a pre -Christian spring rite and rite of fertility.
In the more traditional churches during the Easter weekend on Saturday night, the Easter vague often takes place, where at midnight the rally often turns into a celebration of the resurrection of Christ.
