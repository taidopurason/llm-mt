There is a tradition in which people wake up on Easter night in some exposed place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but they may just as well be pre-Christian festivals of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, when the congregation often erupts into a celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
