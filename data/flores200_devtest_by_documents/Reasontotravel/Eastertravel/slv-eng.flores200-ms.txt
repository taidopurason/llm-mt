According to tradition, Easter has to be overwhelmed in some exposed place and wait for sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological interpretations for this tradition, but it can also be a pre-Christian spring ritual and fertility ceremony.
In more traditional churches, the Easter vigil often takes place during the Easter weekend on Saturday night, where at midnight the convention often turns into a celebration of Christ's resurrection.
