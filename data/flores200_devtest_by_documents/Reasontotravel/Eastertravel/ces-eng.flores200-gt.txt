There is a tradition in which people wake up Easter night in some exposed place to see sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations of this tradition, but it can be just as well as pre -Christian holidays of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches are often organized by Easter vigils on Saturday nights during the Easter weekend, when Congregation often breaks out to celebrate in midnight to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ.
