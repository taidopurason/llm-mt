Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), moves around the Earth.
That sounds reasonable, because it doesn't occur to humans that the Earth is moving, does it?
