Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), moves around the Earth.
That sounds reasonable, because it doesn't occur to man that the Earth is moving, right?
