A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarh said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), was rotating around the earth.
This seems reasonable because we have no feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
