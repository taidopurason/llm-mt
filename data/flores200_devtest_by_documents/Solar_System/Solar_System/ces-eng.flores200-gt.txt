Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite;that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars) moves around the ground.
That sounds sensible, because one doesn't come, that the earth is moving, isn't it?
