Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite â€“ the solar system, along with the Sun (and even other stars), moved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, because there is no feeling that the Earth is moving, does it?
