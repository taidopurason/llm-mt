Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel as if it's moving, does it?
