The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust.The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The bark is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It is thinner under the heat and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the closer side because the crust is thinner.It was easier to get to the surface on the lava.
