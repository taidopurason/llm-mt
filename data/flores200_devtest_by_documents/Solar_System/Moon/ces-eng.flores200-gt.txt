The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust.The outer layer of the moon is called a crust.
The bark is approximately 70 km thick on the forthcoming side and about 100 km on the other side.
Below the sea is weaker and under the mountains again stronger.
On the closer side there can be more lunar seas, because the bark is thinner here.Lava could thus get to the surface more easily.
