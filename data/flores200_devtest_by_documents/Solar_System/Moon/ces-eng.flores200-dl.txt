The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the inverted side and about 100 km thick on the outverted side.
It is weaker under the sea and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner there. The lava could have reached the surface more easily.
