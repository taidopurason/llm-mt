The Moon's surface is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. Lava has risen more easily to the surface.
