Ancient China portrayed different periods of time in a particular way; each stage of China, or each family in power, was a distinctive dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between dynasties, when provinces were divided. The most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties, which lasted 60 years.
During these periods, fierce battles were fought between many nobles who were in a battle for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the top seat in the Great Palace of Shi'an.
