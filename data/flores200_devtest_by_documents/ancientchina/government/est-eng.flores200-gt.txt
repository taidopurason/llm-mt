Old China had a unique way to describe different time periods;Each family of Chinese history or every family had a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable era of provinces between each dynasty.The most well -known of these eras was the era of the three kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and the Jini dynasties.
During this period, there was a furious combat between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The era of three countries was one of the bloodiest times in ancient Chinese history - thousands of people were killed in battles because they hoped to get Xi'an's big palace to the highest place of power.
