Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides are made up of one to three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
