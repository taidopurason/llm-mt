An increasingly more popular option for those planning a gap-year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year out before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling on a gap-year course abroad can actually improve your chances of moving into higher education back in your home country.
Typically there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
