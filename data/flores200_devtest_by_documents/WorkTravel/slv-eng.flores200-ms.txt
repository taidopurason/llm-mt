An increasingly popular option for those planning a year off between school is travel and learning.
It is especially popular with students of recent years, as it offers them a free year before starting their studies without sacrificing their education.
It often happens that education during a one-year stay abroad actually increases the likelihood of continuing to study an individual in their country of origin.
Usually, participation in these educational programs requires payment of tuition fees.
