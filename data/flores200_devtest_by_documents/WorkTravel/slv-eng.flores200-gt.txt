An increasingly popular option for those who plan a year of break during school is travel and learning.
It is especially popular with the last year students, as it offers them a free year before their studies without having to sacrifice their education.
It is often the case that education during a one -year stay abroad actually increases the likelihood of continuing the study of an individual in his home country.
Usually a tuition fee is required to participate in these educational programs.
