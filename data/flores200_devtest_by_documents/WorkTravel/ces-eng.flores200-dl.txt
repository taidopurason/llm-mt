An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with people who are finishing school. It allows them to take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad after high school can improve your chances of higher education in your home country.
There will usually be a tuition fee for enrolling in these educational programs.
