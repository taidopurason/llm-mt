An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and study.
It is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before going to university without having a negative impact on their educational path.
In many cases, taking a course abroad in a gap year can improve your chances of continuing your higher education in your home country.
Tuition is generally charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
