An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and study.
This is particularly popular with secondary school students, allowing them to take a gap year before going to university without being penalised.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can improve your chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
Enrolment in these programmes is usually subject to a tuition fee.
