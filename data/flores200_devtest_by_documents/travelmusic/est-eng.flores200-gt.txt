For some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on the spot and consider it a very important part of this experience.
If you want to be close to the riot, you need to go early to get a camping place near the music.
Remember that while the main stages may no longer be played, there may be other stages at the festival where they play until late at night.
Some festivals have special campgrounds for families with young children.
