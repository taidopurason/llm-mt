At some festivals, the vast majority of visitors to music festivals decide to camp on the spot, and most visitors believe this is a key part of the experience.
If you want to be at the center of what is happening, you have to get there early to get a camping location close to music.
Although the music may be silent on the main stages, it should be borne in mind that in some venues of the festival, music can play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping places for families with young children.
