For some festivals, a significant majority of visitors choose to camp on site and most attendees consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the thick of the action, you will need to arrive as early as possible to get a camping spot that is close to the music production.
Remember that while the music may have ended on the main stage, music may continue late into the night in other sections of the festival.
Some festivals include special campsites for families with young children.
