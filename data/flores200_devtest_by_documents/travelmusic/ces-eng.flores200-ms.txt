In the case of some festivals, a substantial majority of visitors choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the center of the action, you'll need to arrive as early as possible to get a tent spot that's close to the music production.
Keep in mind that while the music on the main stage may have ended, in other sections of the festival the music may continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
