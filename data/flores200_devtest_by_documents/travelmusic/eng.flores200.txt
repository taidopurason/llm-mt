For some festivals, the vast majority of the attendants to music festivals decide to camp on site, and most attendants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you're going to have to get in early to get a camping site close to the music.
Remember that even though music on the main stages may have finished, there may be sections of the festival that will keep playing music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
