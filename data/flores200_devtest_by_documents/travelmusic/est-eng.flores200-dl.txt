For some music festivals, most participants choose to camp on site and consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that although there may no longer be music playing on the main stages, there may be other stages at the festival that play until the late hours.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
