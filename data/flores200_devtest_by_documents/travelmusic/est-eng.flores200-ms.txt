For some music festivals, most of the participants choose to camp on site and consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the rut, you need to get there early to get a camping spot close to music.
Keep in mind that while music may no longer be played on the main stages, the festival may have other stages where you play until the late hours of the evening.
Some festivals have special campgrounds designed for families with small children.
