Just as Paris is today known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury was established around 400 AD. and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its status declined somewhat in the twelfth century as the Crusaders returned home with gifts of silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
