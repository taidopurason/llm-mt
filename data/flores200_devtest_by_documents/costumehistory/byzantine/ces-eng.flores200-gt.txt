Just as Paris is known as the center of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the Center of Fashion of Feudal Europe.
His glory as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD.and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its importance decreased during the twelfth century, mainly because of the fact that the participants of the Crusades came back to Europe, such as silk and spices, and they were at home higher than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of the capital of fashion from Constantinople to Paris was transferred.
