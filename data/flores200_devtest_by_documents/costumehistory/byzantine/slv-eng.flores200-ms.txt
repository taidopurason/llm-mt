Like Paris today known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was sometimes considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation, for which he was designated as the center of luxury, established itself around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its status declined slightly in the twelfth century as the crusaders returned home full of gifts in the form of silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
During this time, the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
