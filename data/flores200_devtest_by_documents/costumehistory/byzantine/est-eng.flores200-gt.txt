Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was seen as a feudal European fashion capital.
Its reputation as a place where all the luxury was concentrated, began about 400 AD in the year and lasted until about about about a year of 1100 AD.
Its status fell in the twelfth century mainly because the crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more valuable than the Byzantine markets offered.
At that time, the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
