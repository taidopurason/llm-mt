The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, which had its roots in the East.
However, due to the slow channels of communication, styles in the West may have lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most notable developments of this period, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
