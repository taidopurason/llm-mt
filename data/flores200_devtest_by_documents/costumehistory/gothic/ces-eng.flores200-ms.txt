The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, dress was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of this time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to button clothes.
