In remote locations where there is no mobile broadcast, the satellite phone may be your only option.
The satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors to make a phone call in the outlook of satellite.
The service is often used by shipping, including a pleasure ship, as well as expeditions that require distance data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
