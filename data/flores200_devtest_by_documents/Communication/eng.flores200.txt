In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outdoors with clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions who have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give more information about connecting to this service.
