Although AI is strongly associated with a science, AI forms are a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
The AI study involves automation of machines in such a way as to solve tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include inspection, planning and schedule, the ability to answer customers' diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions for real life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and military areas, and is also built in several home computers and video game software applications.
