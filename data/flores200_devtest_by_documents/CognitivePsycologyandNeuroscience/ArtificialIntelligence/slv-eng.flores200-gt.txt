Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction tone, it consists of a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of the machine.
Research in the AI is covering the manufacture of automation machines that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include supervision, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and identify font, voice and face.
These things have become separate industries that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and army, as it is installed in numerous software for PCs and video games.
