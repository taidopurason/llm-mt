Although AI is strongly associated with the scientific community, forms of AI are a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation.
The study of AI involves the automation of machines to solve tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and has also been built into many home computers and video game software applications.
