Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, it is a very important area of computer science dealing with the behaviour, learning and intelligence adaptation of machines.
AI research involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and queries, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and are built into many home computer applications and video game software.
