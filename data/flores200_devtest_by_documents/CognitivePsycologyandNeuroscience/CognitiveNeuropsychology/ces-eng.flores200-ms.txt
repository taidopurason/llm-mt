Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. They thus narrow and refine this area of research.
Scientists in their research are supported by the correlation between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and explore brain structures and never-before-seen processes.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for creating simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our minds.
