Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. So, they narrow the research area and significantly increase its accuracy.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports theses in scientists' research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and lead to alterations in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate never-before-seen brain structures and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand how processes in our heads unfold.
