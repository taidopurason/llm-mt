Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. It thus delimits the field of research and makes it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behaviour underpins researchers' research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies is allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This has provided us with a wealth of information and material to create simulation models to help us better understand the processes in our brains.
