Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. They therefore narrow the field of research and significantly increase its precision.
The link between brain pathology and behaviour supports the theses in the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand how processes in our minds work.
