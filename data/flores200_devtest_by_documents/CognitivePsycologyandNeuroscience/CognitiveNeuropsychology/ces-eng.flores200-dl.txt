Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They thus narrow and refine this research area.
Scientists are encouraged in their research by the correlation between brain disease and behaviour.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that have never been observed before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for creating simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
