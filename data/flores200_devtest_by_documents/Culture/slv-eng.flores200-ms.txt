In 1956, Slania moved to Sweden, where three years later he began working for the Swedish Post and became their main engraver.
For Sweden and 28 other countries, it produced more than 1000 brands.
His work is so recognizable for its quality and detail that he is one of the few "famous" among philatelists. Some focus on collecting only his works.
His outstanding 1000th "The Great Deeds of Swedish Kings" by David Kl√∂cker Ehrenstrahl from 2000 made it to the Guinness Book of World Records.
In many countries, he was hired to engrave banknotes, and recent examples of his work include portraits of Prime Ministers on the front of Canada's new $5 and $100 banknotes.
