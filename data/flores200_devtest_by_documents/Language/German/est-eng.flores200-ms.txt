All nouns, including the word Sie ('you'), always begin with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between a few verbs and an object.
Arguably, this makes reading easier, although writing is again more complicated, since it is necessary to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used as a noun.
