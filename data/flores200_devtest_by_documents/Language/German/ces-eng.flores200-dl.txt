All nouns with the word Sie (you) are always capitalized at the beginning and even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and subjects.
It probably also makes it easier to read, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether the verb or adjective is being used in the substantivized form.
