All nouns along with the word Sie (you) are always capitalized at the beginning and even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to find out if a verb or adjective is used in a noun form.
