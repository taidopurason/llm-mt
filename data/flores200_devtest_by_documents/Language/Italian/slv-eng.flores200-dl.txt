Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, with most words pronounced exactly as they are written.
You should pay particular attention to the letters c and g, as their pronunciation differs depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, try to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means chariot.
