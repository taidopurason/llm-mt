In Italian, pronunciation is quite simple, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The basic letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes depending on the next vowel.
"Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means ''dear'', but carro means ''chariot'."
