In Italian, the pronunciation is relatively simple, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to be careful are C and G, because their pronunciation varies according to the vowel that follows them.
Also, beware of the different pronunciations of the sounds R and RR: "Caro" means "dear", while "Carro" means "car".
