In Italian, pronunciation is quite easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The basic letters to pay attention to are C and G as their pronunciation changes depending on the next vowel.
"Also pronounce R and RR in a different way: Caro means" "dear", but Carro means "" gig "."
