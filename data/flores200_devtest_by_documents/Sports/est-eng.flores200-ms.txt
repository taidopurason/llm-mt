U.S. Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and approves of the need for the Olympic family to elevate a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with USOC's assertion that the interests of our athletes, clubs and their sports would be better served if, instead of withdrawing certificates, there were a significant change in our organization.
The U.S. Gymnastics Federation supports an independent investigation that could bring to light how the proportion of abuse boldly described by Larry Nassar's victims went unnoticed for so long, and embraces any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal – to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and inspiring environment.
Giancarlo Fisichella lost control of his car and stopped racing soon after the start.
His team member Fernando Alonso led the race most of the time, but it ended right after the pit stop, presumably due to a poorly fastened right front wheel.
Michael Schumacher stopped shortly after Alonso due to suspension damage due to numerous overtaking during the race.

Skiing is a major travel activity among many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski-bums", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in one particular location.
Skiing is very old – skiers are depicted on cave drawings as much as 5000 years BCE!
Alpine skiing as a sport was practiced as early as the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first amateur skiing club in Australia.
Hiking on skis: This activity is also called skiing in the wild, a ski tour, or a ski hike.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but usually does not include them. Alpine skiing or mountaineering is usually done on terrain with a steep slope, and for them you need much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel somewhat larger distances than when walking, but, despite the well-maintained tracks, you will very rarely achieve such a cross-country skiing speed, similar to driving without a backpack.
