More than four million people went to Rome to attend the funeral.
The number of people present was so great that not everyone was able to get to the funeral in St Peter's Square.
Several large television screens were set up on several sides of Rome so that people could follow the ceremony.
In many other Italian cities and elsewhere in the world, especially in Poland, similar things were set up and watched by large crowds.
