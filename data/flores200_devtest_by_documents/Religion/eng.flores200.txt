Over four million people went to Rome to attend the funeral.
The number of people present was so large that it was not possible for everybody to gain access to the funeral in St. Peter's Square.
Several large television screens were installed in various places in Rome to let the people watch the ceremony.
In many other cities of Italy and in the rest of the world, particularly in Poland, similar setups were made, which were viewed by a great number of people.
