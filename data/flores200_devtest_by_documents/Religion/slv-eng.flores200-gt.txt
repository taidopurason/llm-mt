The funeral in Rome was attended by more than four million people.
There were so many people present that it was by no means possible to provide access to a funeral at St.Peter.
In order for people to be able to watch the ceremony, several large television screens have been erected in different places around Rome.
Similar layouts, which have been viewed by many people, have also been taken care of in many other Italian cities and elsewhere in the world, especially in Poland.
