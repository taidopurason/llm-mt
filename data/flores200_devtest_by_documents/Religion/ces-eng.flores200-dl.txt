More than four million people went to Rome for the funeral.
The number of people present was so great that it was impossible for everyone to get to the funeral in St. Peter's Square.
Large television screens were placed at various locations in Rome so that people could watch the ceremony.
In many other cities in Italy and in the rest of the world, especially in Poland, similar screenings took place and were watched by large numbers of people.
