While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including a boar, a peacock, snails, and one rodent named unimouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate while sitting on chairs, rich men liked feasts where they ate while resting in a sideways position.
The dishes of ancient Rome could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and not a single Roman ever tasted turkey.
