Although their food would mostly seem known to us, the Romans had quite strange or unusual holiday dishes, including a wild boar, peacock, snail and a species of rodent called the polh.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat on chairs, the rich men preferred to enjoy their meals together, lying on the side during dining.
Old Roman meals could not contain food that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, no tomatoes, potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans never tried turkey meat.
