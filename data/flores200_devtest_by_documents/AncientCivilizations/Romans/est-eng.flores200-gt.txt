While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans played a role in strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, actions and one rodent named UNIAIR.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate while sitting on the chairs, the rich men liked the feasts where they ate in a cheating position.
Old-Roman food could not contain foods that came from Europe to America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no Romans ever tasted turkey.
