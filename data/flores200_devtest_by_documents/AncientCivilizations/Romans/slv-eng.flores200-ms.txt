Although their food would seem familiar to us, the Romans had quite a lot of strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a species of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat in chairs when dining, wealthy men preferred to enjoy their feast together, lying on their side while dining.
Ancient Roman meals could not contain food that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey meat.
