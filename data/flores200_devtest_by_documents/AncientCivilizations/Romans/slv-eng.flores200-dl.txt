Although most of their food would seem familiar to us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a slug.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat on chairs to eat, rich men preferred to enjoy their feasts together, lying on their sides while they ate.
Old Roman meals could not have included food that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey meat.
