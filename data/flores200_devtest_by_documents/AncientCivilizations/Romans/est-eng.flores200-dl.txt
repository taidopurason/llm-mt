While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a rodent called the dream mouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked feasts where they ate while resting in a reclining position.
Ancient Roman food could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
