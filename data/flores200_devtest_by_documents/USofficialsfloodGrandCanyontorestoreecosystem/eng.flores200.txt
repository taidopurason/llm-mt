After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal floods that would spread sediment throughout the river were halted.
This sediment was necessary for creating sandbars and beaches, which served as wildlife habitats.
As a result, two fish species have become extinct, and two others have become endangered, including the humpback chub.
Although the water level will only rise a few feet after the flood, officials are hoping it will be enough to restore eroded sandbars downstream.
