Previously, Ring's CEO, Jamie Siminoff, remarked the company started when his doorbell wasn't audible from his shop in his garage.
He built a WiFi door bell, he said.
Siminoff said sales boosted after his 2013 appearance in a Shark Tank episode where the show panel declined funding the startup.
In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on shopping television channel QVC.
Ring also settled a lawsuit with competing security company, the ADT Corporation.
