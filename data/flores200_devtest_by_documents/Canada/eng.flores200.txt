Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and features an array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Farther south is Niagara Falls and the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of the Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some is nearly uninhabited wilderness.
For a comparison of population that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
