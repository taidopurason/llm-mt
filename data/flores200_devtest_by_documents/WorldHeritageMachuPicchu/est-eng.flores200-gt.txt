Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings - namely intihuatana, sunshade and three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex are rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they initially looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
