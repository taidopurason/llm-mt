Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Sun Tower and the Sanctuary of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and restoration is still ongoing today.
