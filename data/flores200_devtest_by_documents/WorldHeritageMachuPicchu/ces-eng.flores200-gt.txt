Machu Picchu is made up of three main heels: intihuatan, temple of the sun and room of three windows.
Most buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to have tourists have a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like ..
By 1976, 30 % of Machu Picchu was restored and the restoration continues to this day.
