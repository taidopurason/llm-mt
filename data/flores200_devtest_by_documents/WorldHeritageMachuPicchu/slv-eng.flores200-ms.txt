Machu Picchu consists of three main constructions, namely Intihuatana, Solar Tower, and the Three-window Sanctuary.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to help tourists imagine what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and reconstruction is ongoing today.
