Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings â€“ namely, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
