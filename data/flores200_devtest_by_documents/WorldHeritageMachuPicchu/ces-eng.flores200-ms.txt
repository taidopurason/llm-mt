Machu Picchu consists of three main footings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
