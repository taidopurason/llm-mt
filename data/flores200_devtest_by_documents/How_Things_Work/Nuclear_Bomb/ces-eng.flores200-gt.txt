The fission nuclear bomb works on the principle that the kernel with many protons and neutrons together is needed.
It's something like driving a heavy trolley uphill.By re -establishing the atomic core, part of this energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they tend to disintegrate in fine or even no contact.
