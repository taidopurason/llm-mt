A nuclear fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's like carrying a heavy cart up a hill. By redistributing the atomic nucleus, some of this energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with subtle or even no contact.
