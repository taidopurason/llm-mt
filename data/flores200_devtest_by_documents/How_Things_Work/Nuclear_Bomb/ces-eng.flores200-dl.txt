A fission nuclear bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's like driving a heavy cart up a hill. The reunification of the atomic nucleus then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart on gentle or even no contact.
