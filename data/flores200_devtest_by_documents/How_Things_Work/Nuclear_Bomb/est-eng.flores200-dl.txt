A nuclear bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to pack a cell nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Sort of like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Re-assembling the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay in a small bump or spontaneously.
