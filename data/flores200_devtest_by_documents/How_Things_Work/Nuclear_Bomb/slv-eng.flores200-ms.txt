The fission bomb works by requiring energy to combine the nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart into a hill. Part of this energy is then released by re-cleavage of the nucleus.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they usually disintegrate on their own or almost without help.
