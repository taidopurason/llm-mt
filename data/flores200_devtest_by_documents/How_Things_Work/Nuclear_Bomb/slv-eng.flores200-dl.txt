A fission bomb works by requiring energy to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy trolley uphill. Some of this energy is then released by splitting the nucleus again.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they usually disintegrate on their own or almost without help.
