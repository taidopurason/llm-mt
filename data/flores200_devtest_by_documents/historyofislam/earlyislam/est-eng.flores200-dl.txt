Muhammad took a keen interest in things deeper than secular life. He used to go often to contemplate in a cave on Mount Noor ('the light'), which became known as Hira.
The cave, which has survived the ages, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, perched on the top of a hill north of Mecca.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find it, even if one were to report that it exists. Once inside the cave, it is completely isolated.
There is nothing to see except a clear beautiful sky and numerous surrounding mountains. Inside the cave, very little of this world can be heard or seen.
