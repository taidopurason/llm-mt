Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside the realm of worldly life. He often visited the cave known as "Hira" on the mountain called "Noor" (light) and contemplated there.
The cave itself, which has survived for a considerable time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
With its location on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if one knew it existed. Inside the cave, it is in complete isolation.
There is nothing to be seen but a beautifully clear sky and a large number of surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
