Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this earthly life. He would visit the cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has survived the test of time, gives a very clear idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave, located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely remote from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if we know it exists. Inside, however, the cave offers complete solitude.
Apart from the clear, beautiful sky overhead and the many surrounding mountains, there is nothing else to see. From inside the cave, little of this world can be seen or heard.
