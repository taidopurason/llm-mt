Mohammed was very interested in things beyond this earthly life.He visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) to think.
The cave itself, which has spent the test of time, gives a very clear idea of Mohammed's spiritual aspirations.
The cave located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca is completely away from the rest of the world.
It is basically not easy to find, even if we know it exists.The interior of the cave, however, offers complete solitude.
Except for a clear, beautiful sky over the head and many surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen.From the inside of the cave you can see or hear little from this world.
