Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside the realm of secular life. He often visited the cave known as "Hira" on a mountain called "Noor" (light) and contemplated there.
The cave itself, which has survived for a considerable time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
Nestled on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if it is known that it exists. Inside the cave is in complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen but a beautifully clear sky and a large number of surrounding mountains.
