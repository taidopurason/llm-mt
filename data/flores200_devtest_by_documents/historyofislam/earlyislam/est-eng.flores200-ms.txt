Muhammad took a keen interest in things deeper than secular life. He had a habit of often meditating in a cave on Mount Noor ('light'), which became known as Hira.
The cave that survived the times gives a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, being located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it's not at all easy to find if one were to announce that it exists. If you are already in a cave, it is completely separated.
There is nothing to see except a clear beautiful sky and numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world is heard and shines inside the cave.
