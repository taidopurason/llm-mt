Muhammad was of great interest in secular life in deeper things.It was customary for him to often reflect on the young ('light') cave on the mountain, which became known as Hira.
The cave that survived the times gives a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave is completely separated from the rest of the world, located at the top of a mountain north of Mecca.
In fact, it is not easy to find it at all if you announce that it exists.If you are already in the cave, it is completely separated.
There is nothing to see other than a clear beautiful sky and numerous surrounding mountains.There is very little in the cave and shines in this world.
