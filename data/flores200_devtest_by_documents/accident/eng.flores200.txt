Although three people were inside the house when the car impacted it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver sustained serious injuries to the head.
The road where the crash happened was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalised in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently relocated to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
