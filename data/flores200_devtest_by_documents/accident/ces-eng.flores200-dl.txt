Although there were three people in the house when the car struck, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered a serious head injury.
The road where the collision happened was temporarily closed while emergency services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalised at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
