Although there were three people in the house when a car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road affected by the collision was temporarily closed so that emergency driver services could be freed from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
