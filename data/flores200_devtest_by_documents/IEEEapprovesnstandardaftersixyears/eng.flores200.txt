The 802.11n standard operates on both the 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.
This will allow it to be backwards compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided that the base station has dual radios.
The speeds of 802.11n are substantially faster than that of its predecessors with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600Mbit/s.
