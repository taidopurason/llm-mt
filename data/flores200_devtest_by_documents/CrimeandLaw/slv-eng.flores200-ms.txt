One of the bombs blew up in front of the office of the Governor-General.
Three more bombs exploded near government buildings within two hours.
In some reports, the official number of deaths is eight, up to 30 injured are confirmed in official reports, and the final figures are not yet known.
Both cyanuric acid and melamine were found in urine samples from pets that died from eating poisoned food.
The two compounds react with each other to form crystals that can interfere with normal kidney function, according to researchers from the university.
The researchers observed that the addition of melamine and cyanuric acid to cat urine formed crystals.
When compared with infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the composition of these crystals is consistent with the composition of those found in the urine of affected pets.
