The U.S. Corps of Engineers estimated that 6 inches of rainfall could breach the previously damaged levees.
The Ninth Ward, which saw flooding as high as 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, is currently in waist-high water as the nearby levee was overtopped.
Water is spilling over the levee in a section 100 feet wide.
