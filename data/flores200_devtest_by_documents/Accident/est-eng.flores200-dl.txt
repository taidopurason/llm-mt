When the car hit the house, three people were inside, but none of them was injured.
The driver, however, suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed until the emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
