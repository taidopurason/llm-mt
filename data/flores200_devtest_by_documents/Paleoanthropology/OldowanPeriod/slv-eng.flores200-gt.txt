Primat with a digestive system similar to human, with plant sources available in the savannah, is difficult to meet the needs of amino acids.
In addition, if this needs cannot be satisfied, there are serious consequences: lag in growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would be proteins present in leaves and legumes, which are difficult to digest if not cooked for primates, including us.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also a source of high quality protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, it should not surprise us if our ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in some extent the same way as they do today in the Savanna.
