It is difficult for primates with human-like digestive systems to meet the need for amino acids from plant sources available in the open savanna.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth of depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the protein available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us as primates to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a high amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved the protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savannah.
