In the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs with available plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant sources would have been the proteins found in leaves and vegetables, but primates like us can easily digest them only when cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large quantities of proteins containing all the necessary amino acids.
Given all this, we shouldn't be surprised that our own ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way as chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
