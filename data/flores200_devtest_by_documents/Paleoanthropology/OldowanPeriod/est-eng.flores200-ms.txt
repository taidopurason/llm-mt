In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of a person to meet its amino acid needs with the help of available plants.
Moreover, if this cannot be done, it will have serious consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant sources would have been proteins in leafy and vegetable crops, but for primates like us, they are easy to digest only when cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digested, but also provides a large amount of proteins that contain all the necessary amino acids.
Given all this, we should not be surprised that our own predecessors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
