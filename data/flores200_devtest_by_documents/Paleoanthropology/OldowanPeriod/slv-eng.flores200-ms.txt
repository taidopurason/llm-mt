A primate with a human-like digestive system, with plant sources available in the savannah, is difficult to meet amino acid needs.
In addition, if this need cannot be met, serious consequences occur: growth retardation, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant sources would be proteins present in leaves and legumes, which are difficult to digest for primates, including us, if they are not cooked.
Conversely, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also a source of high-quality protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
