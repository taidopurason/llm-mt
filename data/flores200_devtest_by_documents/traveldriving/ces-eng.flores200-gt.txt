Anyone who controls high geographical height or mountain pass was supposed to consider snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On ice and snowy roads, friction is low and therefore you cannot drive as well as on the bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow attacks in a very short time to make it impossible to ride.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or flying snow or plowing or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
LED and snow, on the other hand, are normal in many countries and the traffic continues without major interruptions throughout the year.
