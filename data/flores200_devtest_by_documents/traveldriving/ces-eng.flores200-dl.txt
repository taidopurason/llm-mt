Anyone driving at high altitude or in a mountain pass should have considered the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
Friction is low on icy and snowy roads, so you can't drive as well as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow falls in a very short time to make driving impossible.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling or flying snow or by dew or ice on the vehicle windows.
Ice and snow, on the other hand, are normal in many countries and traffic continues without much interruption throughout the year.
