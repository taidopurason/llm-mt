Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive in the same way as you would if you were on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow may fall in a short period of time to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or drifting snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries and traffic continues to flow throughout most of the year.
