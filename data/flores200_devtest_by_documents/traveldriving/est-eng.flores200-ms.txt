Everyone who travels in high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility that there may be snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy highways, the friction force is low, and you can't drive the same way you do when you're on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a short time to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or flying snow, or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues more or less continuously throughout the year.
