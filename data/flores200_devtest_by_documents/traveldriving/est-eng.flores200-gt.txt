Anyone who is driving at high latitudes or over the gorge should take into account the possibility that snow, ice or low temperatures may occur.
The icy and snowy roads have a small friction force and you cannot drive the same way as you are on the bare asphalt.
During the snow storm, enough snow may be rainy in a short period of time to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or flying snow or condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions in many countries are commonplace and traffic continues mostly throughout the year.
