Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is poor and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or wind-blown snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are commonplace in many countries and traffic is largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
