Internal poisoning is not always the most obvious.Signs such as vomiting are general enough that it is not possible to diagnose an immediate diagnosis.
The main sign indicating internal poisoning is the possible presence of open packaging with medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check at the label that specific first aid instructions are indicated for this poison.
