Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are fairly general and do not allow an immediate diagnosis.
A clear sign of ingested or ingested poison may be an open medicine bottle or toxic household chemicals nearby.
Check the label for instructions on first aid for a particular poison.
