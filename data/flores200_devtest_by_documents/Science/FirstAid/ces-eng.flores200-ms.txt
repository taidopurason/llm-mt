Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning can be the presence of an open container with medicines or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
