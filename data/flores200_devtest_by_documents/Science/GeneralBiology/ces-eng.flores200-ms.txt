The Hersheyâ€“Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether germline cells have been affected.
Only germline mutations can be transmitted to children, and mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
