The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main clues that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their own DNA into the bacterium using phages or viruses.
They carried out two experiments where they labelled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulphur.
The effects of mutations can be very different depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material and whether germ cells are affected.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, but elsewhere mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
