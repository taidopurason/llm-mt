Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phaags or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two attempts by noting either radioactive phosphorus or radioactive sulfur in the DNA phage.
Mutations may have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material and whether the cells of the affected cells are the cells of the germ.
Only mutations of the germinous cells can be inherited for children, mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
