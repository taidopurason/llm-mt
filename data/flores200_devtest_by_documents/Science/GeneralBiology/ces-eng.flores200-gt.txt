Hershey -Chase experiment was one of the main evidence that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant your own bottom into bacteria.
They performed two experiments in which they either labeled DNA in a phage with radioactive phosphorus or protein in a pipe with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the meaning of the influenced piece of genetic material and whether the cells of the germ line have been affected.
Only mutations in the germ line of cells can be transmitted to children, while other mutations may cause cell or cancer.
