The Hershey and Chase attempt was one of the main hints that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their own DNA into the bacterium using phags or viruses.
Two experiments were carried out to indicate the DNA in the Fag with radioactive phosphorus or the FAGA protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can be very different, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the calling cells are affected.
Only mutations of calling cells can be transmitted to children, and elsewhere mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
