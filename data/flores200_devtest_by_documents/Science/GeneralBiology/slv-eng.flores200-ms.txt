The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main clues that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their own DNA into the bacterium using phages or viruses.
Two experiments were conducted in which DNA in the phage was labeled with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary widely, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected portion of genetic material and whether germ cells are affected.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while elsewhere mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
