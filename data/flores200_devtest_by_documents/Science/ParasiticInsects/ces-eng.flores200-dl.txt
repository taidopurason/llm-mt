The term beetle is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both carpet beetles and bedbugs are cunning, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
