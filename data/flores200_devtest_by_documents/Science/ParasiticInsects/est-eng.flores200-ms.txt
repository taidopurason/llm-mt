Entomologists officially use the term bedbugs for this group of insects.
This term derives from a long-ago acquaintance with bedbugs, which are extremely well adapted to living as a parasite in humans.
Both predatory bedbugs and bed bugs are nidicolic, adapted to life in the nest or in the host's dwelling.
