Naturalists and philosophers turned to the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were established in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Most of the rhythms observed in psychology and behaviour are often fundamentally dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Recurrent rhythms, other than responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that continue periods of continuous cyclical repetition even in the absence of external stimuli.
