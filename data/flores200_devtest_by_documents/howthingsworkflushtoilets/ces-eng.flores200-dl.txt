The towns of Harappa and Mohenjodaro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage disposal systems have been found in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In ancient Rome, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which were visited by men and women together.
