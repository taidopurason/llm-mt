In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet that was connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
The remains of the sewage system have been found in houses in Minoan cities of Crete and Santorino, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women met in mixed societies.
