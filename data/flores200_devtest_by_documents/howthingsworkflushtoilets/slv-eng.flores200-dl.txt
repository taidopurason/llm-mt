In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewerage system.
Remnants of the sewerage system have been found in houses in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilisation, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women met in mixed company.
