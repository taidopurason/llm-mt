For example, the most common photographic film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its proprieties were inherited from the image sensor dimensions of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm long.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore thought to be 3 : 2.
Many commonly used formats (such as the APS group of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
