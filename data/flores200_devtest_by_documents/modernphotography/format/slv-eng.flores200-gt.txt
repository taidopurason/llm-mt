For example, the most widely used photographic format for immovable images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of analog film.
It is still used today, but it is more important that its image ratio has also been taken over by the formats of the digital cameras image sensors.
The 35mm format actually-and somewhat unusual-measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The image ratio of this format (we divide by twelve to gain the most basic relationship in the form of a whole number) is therefore 3: 2.
Many of the usual formats (ASP Family Format) are the same or very close to that ratio between height and width.
