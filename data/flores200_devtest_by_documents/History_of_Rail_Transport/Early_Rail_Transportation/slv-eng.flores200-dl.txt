In England, rails were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks consisted only of parallel planks, they enabled the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the somewhat inferior roads of the time.
Pretty soon, sleepers were used to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, they found that tracks were more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels on the carriages to wear out more quickly.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
