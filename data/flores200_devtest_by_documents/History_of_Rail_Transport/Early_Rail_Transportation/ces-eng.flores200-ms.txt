Horse-drawn railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although stagecoach roads mostly consisted only of parallel boards, they allowed draft horses to reach greater speed and carry heavier loads than on other roads of the time, which were slightly rougher.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was discovered that rails are more efficient if they have a strip of iron on their surface.
This became a common occurrence, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
