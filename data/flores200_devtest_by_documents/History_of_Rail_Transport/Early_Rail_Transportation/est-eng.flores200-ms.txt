Wagon roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve higher speeds and pull larger quantities than the slightly bumpier roads that existed at the time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, gradually it began to be understood that rails are more effective if there are iron bars on top of them.
It became a standard method, but iron consumed more of the wooden wheels of the wagon.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were put into service.
