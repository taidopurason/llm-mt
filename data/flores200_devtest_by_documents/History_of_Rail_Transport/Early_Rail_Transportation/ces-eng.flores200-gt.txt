The horse -drawn pathways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the stagecoach paths mostly consisted only of parallel boards, they allowed towing horses to achieve higher speeds and bring a heavier burden than on the other paths of the time, which were slightly coarser.
The sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place.Gradually, however, it has been found that the tracks are more efficient if the iron belt has a belt on their surface.
This has become a common phenomenon, but iron caused more wear of wooden wheels.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron.In 1767 the first lift rails were introduced.
