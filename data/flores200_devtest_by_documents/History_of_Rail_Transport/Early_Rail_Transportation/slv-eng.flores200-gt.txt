In England, rails were built in the 16th century.
Although wagons were made up of parallel boards only, because of them, the horses they were pulling were able to reach higher speeds and pull higher burdens than on slightly worse roads at the time.
Quite soon, they began to use the thresholds to stay in place.Gradually, however, they found that the tracks were more efficient if they had an iron strip at the top.
This has become a universal practice, but due to iron, wooden wheels on wagons were faster.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron.In 1767, the first rails, which were entirely of iron, were introduced.
