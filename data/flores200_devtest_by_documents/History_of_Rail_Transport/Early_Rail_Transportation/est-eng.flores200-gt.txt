The wagon road was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon roads consisted of all parallel wooden planks, they allowed them to achieve higher speeds and draw higher quantities than the slightly more bumpy roads at that time.
The sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails still.Gradually, however, it was understood that the rails are more effective when the iron strips were on top of them.
It became a standard method, but iron spent more wooden wheels in the wagon.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels.In 1767 the first rails made of iron were introduced.
