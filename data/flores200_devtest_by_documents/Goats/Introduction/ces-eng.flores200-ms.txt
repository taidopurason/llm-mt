Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures and were often guarded by herders, often children or adolescents, like the more famous sheep herders. These methods of pastoralism are still used today.
