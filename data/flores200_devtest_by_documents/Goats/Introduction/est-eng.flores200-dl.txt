Goats appear to have been originally domesticated around 10 000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often herded by herds of kids or teenage goats similar to the more familiar flocks of sheep. These grazing methods are still used today.
