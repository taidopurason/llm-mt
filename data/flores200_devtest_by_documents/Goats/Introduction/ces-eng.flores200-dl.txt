Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often watched over by herders, often children or adolescents, much like the more familiar sheep herders. These methods of herding are still used today.
