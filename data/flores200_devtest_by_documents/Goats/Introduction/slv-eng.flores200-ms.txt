Goats are believed to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds wandering through hills or other grazing areas, and were often cared for by goat shepherds, who were not rarely children or adolescents, much like the more famous sheep shepherds. These herd management methods are still used today.
