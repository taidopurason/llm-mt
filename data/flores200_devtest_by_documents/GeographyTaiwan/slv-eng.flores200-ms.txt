Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European seafarers sailing past the island named it Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan and began a transformation of indigenous grain cultivation methods and hiring Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty military forces (1644–1912) took control of Taiwan's west and north coasts and declared Taiwan a province of Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing dynasty government signed an agreement in Shimonoseka, handing over power over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
