Taiwan was mentioned as early as the 15th century, when passing European sailors wrote down the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in south-western Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain-growing practices and hiring Chinese labourers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Shimonoseki Peace Treaty, which ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
