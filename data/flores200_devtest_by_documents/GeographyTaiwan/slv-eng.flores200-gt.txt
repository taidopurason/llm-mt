The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European seafarers, who sailed past the island, named it Ilha Formos or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Netherlands East Indian society erected a database in southwestern Taiwan and began the transformation of indigenous ways of producing cereals and the employment of Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the CHING Dynasties (1644-1912) took over control of the Taiwan west and north coast and declared Taiwan in 1885 as the provinces of the Ching Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the first Chinese-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Government of the Cinema Dynasty signed an agreement in Šimonosco, which handed power over Taiwan, Japan, which ruled on the island until 1945.
