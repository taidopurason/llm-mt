The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when nearby European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the original grain production practices, employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644–1912) took control of the southwestern and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonosec Peace Treaty, under which it transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. It ruled this island until 1945.
