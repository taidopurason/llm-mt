Taiwan was mentioned as early as the 15th century, when European sailors sailing along wrote down the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeating in the first Sino-Japanese (1894â€“1895) war, the Qing dynasty government signed the Shimonoseki Peace Treaty, which transferred Taiwan's right of government to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
