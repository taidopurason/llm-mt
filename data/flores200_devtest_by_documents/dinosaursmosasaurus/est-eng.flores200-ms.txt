Mosaurus was the top predator of its time and thus feared nothing but other mosaurus.
There were over 70 ultra-sharp teeth in his long jaws, plus extra teeth in his palate, meaning that none of the things his paths crossed with escaped.
This is not known for certain, but the mosasaurus may have had a two-pronged language. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurus, and it may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everyone who went into the water, even a giant dinosaur, as if the T-Rex was no opponent for him.
