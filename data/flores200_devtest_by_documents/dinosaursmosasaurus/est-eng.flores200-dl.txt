The Mosaurus was the top predator of its time and therefore feared nothing except other mosaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 extra-large teeth, plus extra teeth in the palate, meaning that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We don't know for sure, but the mosasaur may have had a double-edged tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it may even have been a man-eater.
It also attacked anyone who went into the water, even a giant dinosaur, as if a T-Rex was no match for it.
