Mosasaurus was the top of the predator of his time, so he wasn't worried about any other Mosasaur.
Its long jaws were covered with more than 70 teeth as sharp as a razor and an extra set set on the upper floor, which means that nothing that would cross its path had no chance to escape.
We do not know for sure, but they could have a jagged tongue.Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe they could be cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water.Even a big dinosaur, such as T. Rex, was no opponent for them.
