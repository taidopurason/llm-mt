Mosaur was a top caretaker of his time and was therefore not afraid of anything other than other mosaurus.
His long jaws had over 70 extremely sharp teeth, plus additional teeth in the palate, which means that nothing that his paths crossed could escape.
It is certainly not known, but the mosaurus may have had a bifurcated language.Its dining table included turtles, large fish, other mosaurons, and may have even been a human eater.
He also attacked everyone who went into the water, even a huge dinosaur, as if T-Rex was not an opponent for him.
