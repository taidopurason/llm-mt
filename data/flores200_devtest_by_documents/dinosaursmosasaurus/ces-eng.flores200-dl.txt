Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it had no fear of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set embedded in the upper palate, meaning anything that crossed its path had no chance of escaping.
We don't know for sure, but their tongues may have been forked. Their diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and they may have been cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water. Even a large dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for them.
