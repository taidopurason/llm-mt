Mosasaurus was the ultimate predator of its time, so it had no fear of anything except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set planted on the top floor, meaning nothing that crossed his path had a chance to escape.
We don't know for sure, but they may have had a forked tongue. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water. Even a large dinosaur like T. rex was no match for them.
