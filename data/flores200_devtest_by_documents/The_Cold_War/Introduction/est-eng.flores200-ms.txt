Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, countries got into a quarrel due to clashes between the system, the process and culture.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and the mandated armies had to actually fight on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
