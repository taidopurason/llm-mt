Late on Sunday, the United States President Donald Trump, in a statement delivered via the press secretary, announced US troops would be leaving Syria.
The announcement was made after Trump had a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan.
Turkey would also take over guarding captured ISIS fighters which, the statement said, European nations have refused to repatriate.
