When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, they move across a mountain range or river or move to a new island, and coming back is not easy), they often find themselves in a different environment from the previous one.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics from the previous ones and needs to adapt to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
As time passes, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they look less and less like another population.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process species formation, which simply means the emergence of a new species. The emergence of species is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
