When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they come from (for example, when a mountain ridge or a river passes or move to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), they often find themselves in a different environment than inwhat they were before.
This new environment has different sources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or ways of adaptation to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they begin to look less and less than other populations.
In the end, for several thousand or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called specialization, which means the emergence of new species.Specialization is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
