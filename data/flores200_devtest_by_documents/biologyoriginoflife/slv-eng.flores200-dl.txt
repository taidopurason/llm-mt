When a small group of living organisms (a small population) moves away from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island and finds it difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment from the one it lived in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to compete with them.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As the new population starts to adapt to the new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population over time.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
