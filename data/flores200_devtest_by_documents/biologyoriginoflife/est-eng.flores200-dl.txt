When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, they move across a mountain range or river, or move to a new island, and returning is not easy), they often find themselves in a different environment from before.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics from the previous one and must adapt to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they will look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
