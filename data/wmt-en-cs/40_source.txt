So like from the beginning for all my birthdays in the past, I always had rough ones.
Whenever May would pop up I dreaded trying to celebrate my bday.
Something would always happen, go wrong, or just end up stressful and depressing.
I fought over the years to get out of that mindset and to have better bdays.
It took years of changing my life and working hard but finally...
I'm starting to smile and enjoy my bday with no worries.
And today is already becoming a great day!
