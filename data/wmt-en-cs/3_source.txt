#Venting into the Fediverse time.
The Domestic Partner and I went to the liquor store tonight for some beers and a bottle of bub.
When we went to check out, the cashier is a fairly obvious #trans woman.
Me, in board shorts and a wife beater, and The Domestic Partner, all tatted up and with a new haircut that he himself described as "making me look like a neo-nazi".
Her body immediately stiffened and there was this look of fear in her eyes.
And then we just... paid for our stuff.
And said thank you.
And I said her nails looked cool.
The smile of relief on her face was a great feeling but the fact that she was scared first FUCKING SUCKS AND I HATE IT.
This is the stupidest timeline and I hate it dot com.
