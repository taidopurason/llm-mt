On the first train today, the ticket checker looked at our tickets and said "long journey!"
"Yeah and I'm coming back today," I said.
"I'm just dropping him off in Glasgow," I attempted to explain, gesturing at my traveling companion.
"There's not something you hear a lot 'I'm just dropping him off in Glasgow,' " the ticket guy said.
It's a thing I've never said before either.
