The thing that last night convinced me of is that we need to be ready to fight back against Trumpism.
Trumpism is a cult.
It is a cult that nobody really wants, except for the fanatics who are in it.
And they are truly nuts.
We can not allow them to hijack our country.
It is time to fight back.
Go out and protest now.
Get some bumper stickers that are anti-Trump and plaster them all over.
Yell back at those who would try to talk over us.
This is not normal.
This is not OK...
