Good umbrella, would buy it again if I had to
First off, I have to say the color is loveeeee.
A lot of things I order in purple always come too light, too kiddish, too weird, too neon-ish, what have you.
But this purple was deep and lush and I love it, the umbrella is sturdy and really good quality.
Probably best umbrella Iâ€™ve had.
Comes with a cover and while it may not have much functional use, it really keeps it looking sharp.
