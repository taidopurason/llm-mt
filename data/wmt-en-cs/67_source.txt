#today I have coffee, sunshine and quiet time!
I started a new shawl.
I am unsure of it at this time.
I found a unevenly spun silver gray yarn that is mostly finely spun with lumps.
I plan on mixing it with a fine purple/lilac variegated cotton.
But am not sure I have enough of the purple.
I am using a H hook with a similar double crochet pattern as I have done before.
I made the first join last night so we shall see.
Wishing everyone a happy Thursday!
