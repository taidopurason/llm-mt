Had a recent graduate artist take some critique badly tonight.
In part, because they'd be taught badly.
But it's important to not make excuses for issues and just fix them, especially in production when your lead needs changes.
Especially with the competition.
Every artist has been there, made the same mistakes.
Good critique is there to correct the problem quickly, and isn't directed at your ability.
It's assuming you have the ability to fix the problem, or find a solution.
