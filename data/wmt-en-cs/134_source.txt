2 bad lemons in a row :(
I ordered from this company because I've bought it previous seasons and it worked great for us.
This season I bought the next size I needed.
One of the pajamas I received had a hole on the foot of the pajama.
I returned it and the company sent me a new one.
The replacement pajama my son wore one time, I put it in my washing machine just like always and the zipper broke off!
I'm so disappointed because I don't have time to be dealing with returns every few days and yet that is what is happening right now.
