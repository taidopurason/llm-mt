Humanity is out in 5 days.
It's exciting, nerve-wracking, stressful, and all the good things that I love about working in games.
What will people think of it?
I like it but will it be able to attract an audience of the right players?
Will a community blossom around the user-generated content piece of the game?
(I am really hoping so.)
The game's story, ideas and questions it inspires feel timely.
Hoping things go well.
