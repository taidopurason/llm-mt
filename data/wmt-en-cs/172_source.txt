Packaging is terrible - received 3 damaged guitars
Very nice looking guitar.
Too bad the company does not know how to protect their product.
Donâ€™t bother trying to receive one that is not damaged.
We returned 2 because of damages in shipping and the the 3rd one was damaged also.
Gave up.
They ship it in the soft thin case with one sheet of brown paper in a cardboard box.
No padding at all.
