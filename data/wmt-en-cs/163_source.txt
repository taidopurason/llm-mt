Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :(
This ring was beautiful.
I loved the design and the chunky feel of it; it looked expensive and it was very comfortable!
The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time.
I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing.
Interestingly enough, the issue I had was that the inner band of the ring was actually turning my finger white and moist - kind of like the way a bandaid does after you leave it on for a long time.
This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger was completely dry.
I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable so I decided it wasn't the ring for me.
:( Too bad because I really did love it!
So if you are purchasing this ring with the intent to wear it only occasionally, I say go for it!!
You won't be disappointed!
