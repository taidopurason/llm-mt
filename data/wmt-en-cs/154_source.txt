Not too easy to assemble plus....
It’s a nice looking piece of furniture when assembled, but assembly was difficult.
Some of the letter markings were incorrectly marked so I had to try and figure out on my own The screws they supplied to attach the floor and side panels all cracked.
I had to go out and purchase corner brackets to make sure they stayed together.
Also the glass panel doors are out of line and don’t match evenly.
This alignment prevents one of the doors from staying closed as the magnet to keep the door closed is out of line.
Still haven’t figured out to align them.
