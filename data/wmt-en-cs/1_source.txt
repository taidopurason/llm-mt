Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support.
Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.
Scientific facts result from experiments.
The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered.
Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise.
This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts.
It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in.
