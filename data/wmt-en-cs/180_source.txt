Ok, needs some improvement.
A decent training tool but it really needs to have some sort of Safety Lock over the shock button( been pressed more on accident when it's in my pocket then I've actually intended to use it) my dogs even accidentally zapped herself after stepping on the remote.
Also if your dog likes to roll around in raccoon poop like mine does it is such a pain in the butt to clean.
As the fecal matter gets in between the cracks of the device requiring you to disassemble the entire thing to clean it properly and get the smell out.
Also the range is a bit inconsistent.
I've noticed you almost need line of sight for it to work.
And there have been times where it has not functioned at all even though I'm only 30 feet away from my dog.
Being rechargeable is certainly a nice feature and the charge does last for a good while.
I only need to charge mine about once every two weeks.
