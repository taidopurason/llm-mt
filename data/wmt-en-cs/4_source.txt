Nothing stops Donald Trump from running for president while under indictment, after being convicted, or even from within a prison cell.
If elected, he would undoubtedly pardon himself to get out of prison.

The two states involved are New York and Georgia.
The latter's Governor Kemp will undoubtedly pardon Trump if convicted or even indicted by Fulton County DA Fannie Willis.
NY is the best hope for accountability
