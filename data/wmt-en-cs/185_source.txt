overheating issues and hard time connecting controller
Im giving it 3 stars for now, i don't want leave a bad review for the seller unless he deserves it but this drone overheats a lot.
Im not sure if i should contact the seller or dji tello themselves but ill probably try both just to see what they say.
I like the drone is a cool little toy that fly's better than some bigger older drones and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one.
However its the only drone i have ever had overheating issues with and it actually takes the fun out of flying im going to assume for now that its a manufacturing issue which they need to address asap if they want there product to be successful.
I really hope the seller did not send me a use drone as i paid for a new one.
I will give the sellers props for delivery as it arrive 1 day after purchase.
I will update date my review after contacting seller and dji tello.
