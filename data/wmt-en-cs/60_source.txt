In 1998-06 Gamefan, in relation to the long development of the first Unreal game, Jason Schrieber commented,
"A good game is only late until it ships.
A bad game is bad forever."
So was it Epic that originated this?
We can keep going.
An earlier issue of GamePro 1997-11 has a quote with far more ambiguity,
"Or, as an industry catch phrase goes: A late game is only late until it ships.
A bad game is bad for the rest of your life."
Is it so ephemeral then?
Merely a "catchphrase" with no clear originator?
