Winter is 30 days away in this little part of the Great Southern World.
But I can't be deceived!
This is the beginning.
The rain is falling and whilst/while it is not frozen, you ain't going dancing in it!
It's a fine day to order ice cream delivery.
It was a one dog night and that doggo was not getting off the bed not even for "Dog's Breakfast - Breakfast for Dog's!"
I will zip the lining into my cycle jacket - just in case I need it inside.
