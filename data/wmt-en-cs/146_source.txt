I really Like this ring light!
It is wonderful for the price and it gets the job done!
The only issue is the light bulb heats up too fast and the light goes out, so I have to turn it off wait for a while then turn it back on.
I don't think that is supposed to happen...I don't know if I have a defective light or what, but it is a very nice ring light besides the overheating.
