So while composting and bloom scrolling are a wonderful reminder to look up, and be aware of life beyond the screen.
It is as important to explore servers and IP addresses.
Watch seeds being sown &amp; cultivated (and not randomly scattered) by good peeps.
These roots are hidden.
Work is not visible.
But for strong and firm future growth.
