Drops internet
I bought this modem/router about two years ago.
At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I’ve had problems with it dropping the internet.
This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired.
The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset.
This was happening once or twice a day.
Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level.
Same problem.
The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem.
Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions.
I had to do a factory reset to restore this.
I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences.
I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router.
It’s fantastic.
I’v Had it for over a week with no problems.
It’s faster and the range is greater than the Arris.
I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast.
If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router.
Get the Netgear, its much more reliable.
