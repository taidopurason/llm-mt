Good, but would like to find something better
After a lot of research, I started using this product many years ago.
It had the least amount of harmful ingredients, and still worked okay.
However, it dries up so quickly that you end up using so much lube, which ends up costing a lot of money, as well as being too disruptive during sex.
I've just been too lazy to look for a new product, but will start looking for one that is both harmless, works well, and not too costly.
