The UPS store near me won't allow me to write a label or write on the box.
The must print the label.
They won't allow me to tell them the address it's going to and who is shipping it.
I have to email some random address, with unformatted data, so the clerk can read the email and enter it into their system to print a label.
And they always to charge me $2.25 for that "convenience".
