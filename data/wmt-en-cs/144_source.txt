don't believe the hype
Too many five-star reviews on this novel need to be tempered by some more realistic assessments.
I tried reading it but I just found the language flat.
the "freshwater" metaphor and the many descriptions of the womb like a river and the baby like a fish seemed forced, hackneyed, and contrived.
I skipped ahead and it looked like all I was going to find was a campus drama.
