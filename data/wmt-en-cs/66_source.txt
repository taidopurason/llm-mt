The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching as you settle the flyer down on the red soil, but they make no move towards you, in fact they are motionless as you climb out of the flyer and walk slowly towards them.
The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble and then shake, as if in an earthquake and you lose your footing, though the Repnids seem unaffected.
The rock beneath you gives way suddenly.
Repnids have tunnelled below the surface and you fall into a boiling mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in a cavern below.
The end is swift, as several pairs of fangs inject their deadly venom and the air of Dyskra contaminates your lungs.
Nobody will ever know that you were the first human future traveller.
You land the flyer nose upward on the side of the slag heap and climb out.
The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they make no move towards you, in fact they are motionless as you walk slowly towards them.
You halt while still on the mound of crumbled rock and soil and speak to them, saying, 'I come in peace, as a friend.'
It appears that they cannot hear you, let alone understand, as your Universal Translator picks up no answer.
You decide to use your Psychic Awareness to contact them mentally.
It is difficult to make sense of their thoughts; they are terrifyingly alien and your mind recoils from the contact.
You decide that establishing contact again would be dangerous and return to your flyer, but the experience has cleared your mind which had been befuddled ever since you jumped into the future.
Once back in Falcon's Wing you find it quite easy to plot a course for Earth in 3034 AD.
Note that you have used up another polybdenum rod as you jump.
