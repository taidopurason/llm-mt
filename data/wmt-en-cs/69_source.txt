My home is comfortable and wonderful and I am happy there, but I have to be somewhere else in order to chill enough to read fiction during the day without feeling guilty.
It's like I'm on holidays and therefore am doing what one does on holidays.
And that's also even though I haven't slept as well here for the last two nights as I do at home, and get a little #MECFS ed out from simply being in a strange environment where I'm less able to pace myself and have to remember where things are.
And that's also even though I do still have my to-do list and am organising my life as well.
