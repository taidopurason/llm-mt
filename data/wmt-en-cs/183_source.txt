My dog hasnt destroyed it yet
Have had probs with Hockey Balls.
My dog loves them - her favorite fetch and chew toy - and they float.
That is until she chews them to bits.
Tried several, even the "hot weather" versions - and they lasted a few minutes longer than the others.
Until these showed up.
These have stood the test.
My dog is not big but she is stubborn about what she chews.
Like they say, its not how big the dog in the fight but how big the fight in the dog.
Thumbs up from Daisy and I.
