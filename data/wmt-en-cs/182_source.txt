Great backpack but overkill on the straps
This backpack looks good and performs well.
It’s a great deal especially when you compare it to what backpacks cost now a days.
The reason I knocked off a star is because there are just too many straps.
There’s more straps on this bag than I can count.
I’ll end up cutting and burning these extra straps off because most of them aren’t really necessary and just get in the way of opening and closing the bag.
Other than that I’ve made this my new school bag for college.
There’s a compartment right in the back of the backpack for my MacBook Pro and all my books fit wel in the pockets provided.
The flag also is a great finish to it
