This product is hazardous to children.
This is a huge health hazard to your baby.
We checked the battery after a couple weeks of use and saw that water went into the compartment where the batteries go.
The batteries themselves had rotted and a black liquid was coming out of them.
Looking at the design, it appears that theres no way the battery enclosure could be waterproof meaning not only did water go into the compartment during bathtime, some of that toxic material came out as well.
Please do not buy this product.
Iâ€™m shocked that it was allowed to go to market despite such an obvious flaw.
