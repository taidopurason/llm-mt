Been toying with this thought for a little while:
Mental health is often seen as something separate from "regular" health.
Why?
Because it happens in the mind and seems less tangible than physical health.
In truth, the health of your mind, of your brain, is just as much an issue of health as the health of your foot.
Intersex is even recognized by TERFs and the like because it's generally more physical and, as such, visible.
In the same way that mental health is seen as less "real" than physical health by many, I kind of feel that being trans is merely intersex of the mind.
The more I read of studies on sex, gender, psychology, the more the statement of "My sex is male, my gender is female" seems simplistic and inaccurate.
It almost seems like ceding part of an argument to TERFs.
I feel that to be trans is to be "biologically non-binary".
My sex is non-binary, my gender is female.
I think the designation of "non-binary" needs to be extended from just a gender term, to be used when referring to sex.
