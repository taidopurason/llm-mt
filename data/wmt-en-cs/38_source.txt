I am so tired of the headlines claiming that "Remote work is dead." or that "Remote work was a failed experiment."
These headlines and articles usually reference one CEO at one large company.
It's all clickbait but it does worry me about the executives and managers who read these articles.
There was remote work prior to 2020.
There are still going to be jobs that can be accomplished remotely for the foreseeable future.
Remote work is enabling.
It enables people to work in comfortable spaces and not stuffy, noisy offices.
It enables accessibility for anyone with an internet connection and a good working space.
It enables people to avoid lengthy commutes that take time away from their day and their families.
To just ignore these facts is wrong.
Stop generalizing and try to understand how your employees actually get work done.
