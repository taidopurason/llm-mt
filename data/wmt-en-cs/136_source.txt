It doesn't wrinkle, even after being crammed into plastic and a box it was very smooth, so that's really cool.
This can easily be dressed down or dressed up, and has a kind of vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I'm really into.
I think this could be flattering on anyone.
I'm 5'5" and 130 pounds and I ordered the small, so I would say if you feel like you're stuck between a small and medium, definitely size down.
