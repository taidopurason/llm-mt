Discovered the hard way that in 2023, local TV station web sites are the absolute worst experience on the internet.
Popups, auto-play videos, animations, popovers, and ads, ads, ads.
I know that advertising is how they make their money, but all that garbage seems counterproductive if it drives people away.
This is true even now that goatse.cx is gone, though it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video the Wendy sent me.
