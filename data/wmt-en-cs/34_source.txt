So with a new #FFXIV raid tier approaching, I've long been thinking "man, I'd like to try proper raiding, but Party Finder sounds like a mess, and I'm never gonna find a static that'll have me."
So I thought, screw it!
I'll make my own static!
Full of people too anxious to try joining a raid static, with no expectations of being good at all!
There's... no way that would work, probably!
...And that's how I found myself having to sort out a raid group roster.
