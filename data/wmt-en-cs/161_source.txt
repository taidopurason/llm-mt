Works well after some headaches.
Had some problems getting it to work.
The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery.
When I replaced cable with my own was able to charge and then connect the device via bluetooth to a PC.
Had trouble finding the PC software but when I emailed their support they responded within a day with the correct download info.
PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case).
The accuracy and stability of the unit look very good for my application, however I was not able to connect to either an iPhone or iPad (tried several of each) via bluetooth.
Will have to hard-wire if I decide to use this device in my product.
