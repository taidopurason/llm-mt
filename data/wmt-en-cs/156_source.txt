Sweetener on the go.
Such a convenience!
It is really nice to have my favorite sugar alternative packaged in little take along packets!
I LOVE swerve, and it is so convenient to have these to throw in my purse for dining out, or to use at a friendâ€™s house.
While they are a bit pricey, I cannot stand Equal or the pink stuff in my iced tea.
Swerve or nothing, so i am thrilled to have my sweetener on the go!
