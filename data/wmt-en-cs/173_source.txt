Cool concept!
Just needs some more improvements to make it a really awesome product
Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing.
I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests.
I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch.
It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone.
For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder.
Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out.
There's no music in the mic itself though.
It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic.
Or you can even sync your Spotify app.
Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately.
The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!)
and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room.
Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic.
If you've figured this out, I'd love to know!
2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky.
I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker.
3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting.
If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.
