(PERSON4) So, I remember that for [PROJECT1] I was doing this from last year from some cottage in the mountains.
And I just realized, shortly before New Year’s Eve that I need to submit it.
And &lt;laugh/&gt; so this is also something that will happen to [PERSON8] I'm afraid that he could be...well, no party, but maybe at the remote party.
And then suddenly he would realize that he has to submit it.
So, there will be no review of like at that point. &lt;laugh/&gt;
He would simply take the PDF and upload it so. &lt;laugh/&gt;
(PERSON7) Well, okay.
So, Yeah, I will check on 21st, and otherwise I will send them an e-mail.
(PERSON4) Please, I think better send them an e-mail right now and just ask for that link in advance.
(PERSON7) Okay.
(PERSON4) Yep thanks.
(PERSON7) Do we have other issues to discuss today, or is that is that everything until the New Year?
(PERSON6) I hope there wasn’t anything for me?
