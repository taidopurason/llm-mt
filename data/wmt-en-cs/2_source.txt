Going to be my first project car.
Picking this up this weekend.
I was looking for a good first car guy car; and I really love the 80s aesthetic.
Already on coil overs and lowered ride height.
I've done a little research but I would love if anyone has any info about this car.
Personal experiences?
I know they're not fast compared
