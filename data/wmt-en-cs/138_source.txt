Good Price for Replacement
The grill of my car was ripped off by a large something flying down the interstate so I needed a replacement.
I was afraid after reading some reviews that this wouldn't fit, but it was perfect!
I own a 2013 Corolla LE.
I didn't put it on myself--I had a guy at a body shop do it for me--but it looked really easy.
It just snapped right on in less than 5 minutes.
I gave it a 4 star for the sturdiness because it does seem pretty flimsy (time and flying debris will tell), but over all I'm very satisfied that my car no longer has a gaping maw on the front now and that the price was reasonable.
