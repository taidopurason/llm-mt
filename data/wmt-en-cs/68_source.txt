However, I hate classes on fine arts and literature, and my school history bears it out.
I have literally tried and dropped EVERY SINGLE ONE.
And up until like two years ago, I had no idea until I checked my transcripts.
The literature class hatred is even worse: I love to read.
I hit most of the classics before eighteen--though that's more a reflection of living in bumfuck nowhere, I also read the 1979 Encyclopedia Brittanica in desperation.
