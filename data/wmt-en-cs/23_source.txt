Here's a quick overview of how to make use of our website.
- We send out notifications when airfare goes on sale.
- We provide links to where you can book the fare.
- We don't sell tickets, or charge a subscription.
- More details are in the full blog post.
- We maintain a list of example booking dates for each deal we post and we update that list several times a day.
