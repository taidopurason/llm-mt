BAD CODE PRINTED ON THE TOP OF THE POD
I purchased these in February.
Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately each time I try one my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the pod is not compatible with my machine.
I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first purchased it and have never had a problem.
Upon closer examination of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod isn't very legible so I can only assume that I have a bad box.
I purchased a box of 72 which is 6 boxes of 12 each.
I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and keep getting the same error message.
I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work just fine.
It's only out of this shipment that I am having this issue.
Very disappointing since my return window has expired.
UPDATE: I talked to a customer representative who refunded by money.
Thank you AMAZON for your wonderful customer support!
