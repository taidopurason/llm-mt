Must buy!!
I loved this rose gold color and everything about it was great!
The only thing I had an issue with, was it was really plain.
I like having a little more detail in the handles and I did notice that before I purchased it which is why I still give this 5 stars!
It was easy to clean and all came in wrapped individually which I found to be really organised and it calmed my soul lol love, love, LOVE the color and I would definitely buy this again for myself or for a loved one!
