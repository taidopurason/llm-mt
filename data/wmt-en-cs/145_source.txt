I give this book 10 stars!
Excellent read!!
I absolutely loved the book!!
I’ve adopted 4 Siamese cats from Siri over the years and everyone of them were absolute loves.
Once you start to read this book, it’s hard to put down.
Funny, witty and very entertaining!!
Siri has gone above and beyond in her efforts to rescue cats (mainly Siamese)!!
