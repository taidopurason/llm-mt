It's 2023 and I still see people with iPhones actively avoid using Apple Maps.
Apple Maps comes default with iOS, and yet people would go out of their way to download and install Google Maps onto their iPhones.
No idea why.
Curious, I kept an open mind to compare how Google Maps and Apple Maps compare, on my test iPhone device (my daily driver is an Android device, so it's rare that I use an iPhone).
The experience having to follow directions was far superior on Apple Maps compared to Google Maps.
Apple Maps wins.
So why is it that people jump through extra hoops to install Google Maps?
No idea.
Could it be that Google Maps got to market first?
Was it the 2012 Apple Maps disaster?
Could it be that Google Search is integrated with Google Maps?
No idea.
That said, I'm biased.
I'm biased in favour of not releasing garbage to end users, and Apple royally fucked up with their Apple Maps when it came out in 2012.
Their bad reputation haunts them to this day.
