but it happens enough to be annoying.
On a positive note
1 of the fans sounded out of balance out of the box.
The speed controls are really wonky -- If you dial them to 100% the fans will shut off, so you need to turn it to 100% then dial it back slowly until the come back on.
Build quality is mediocre, but this seems to be par for most of these types of product at this price point.
The feet for holding the laptop up when it's inclined have snapped off a few times...
They go back in, but it happens enough to be annoying.
On a positive note, this has ideal fan placement for laptops that intake air from vents located near the top of the laptop.
Many other coolers have fans toward the middle and provide very little additional airflow to a laptop with such a cooling configuration.
