(PERSON2) You can I think you can just you can just reserve the whole semester just for [PERSON9]'s courses and you will have a lot of work and no free time, even though you have just one subject.
But I think it's a different thing, because I think it's not really a thing to fail his courses.
Like to fail because you are unable to finish it.
Of course, like people are just giving up, but I mean it's maybe for different reason that just it's impossible to pass.
I think that it's definitely possible, but it's a lot of work.
(PERSON1) Yeah, I think that he told us in the beginning of the semester that well if we want a one (??) you'll get a one.
Just within the second deadline, you should submit it.
That's pretty much the only thing he asked.
But he also told us that judging by previous years' trends, a lot of people don't do that.
They find it easier to read for the exam.
No, sorry, study for the exam-
(PERSON2) Yeah because well in general, his exams are rather easy.
(PERSON2) So I wouldn't say it's super easy, because there are some courses where the exam is like fun.
(PERSON1) Oh well, one of them was yesterday for me.
