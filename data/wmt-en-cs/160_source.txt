Lost package - Re-Charged me
Grew up with these and was psyched to purchase them for my son, but they lost the package of live caterpillars.
They told me they'd replace it and charge half the shipping this time.
After significant phone time they ended up re-charging me for a new order with like a 3$ discount.
I thought it was pretty unprofessional because not only did they lose it, but they led me to believe they'd rectify it only to charge me almost full price at the end of a 30 minute phone call with some spiel about a voucher.
I spent 30 minutes on the phone so I caved and just bought another set of caterpillars.
Whatever.
