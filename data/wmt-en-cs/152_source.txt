The battery life is terrible on the one I bought on Amazon.
Still can’t believe Logitech discontinued this remote, nothing else comes close in comparison.
I absolutely LOVE this Harmony remote, this is my 4th one.
Dog chewed up the first one, husband kneeled on the screen of the second one, and the third ones still working but there’s an elbow mark in the middle of the touch screen also courtesy of the hubby...bought this one as a back up and the screens great but the battery it came with holds a charge maybe for a couple days.
My original (3rd one) keeps a charge for weeks at a time and I use my remote for everything.
