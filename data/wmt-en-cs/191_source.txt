Nothing like the previous Stylo phones, MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.
I've had the original Stylo as well as the Stylo 2, Stylo 2 V and the Stylo 2 Plus.
Clearly I really liked the Stylos considering the fact that every time a new one came out, I purchased it.
Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and "in the loop" and I did.
Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves.
When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that.
This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful.
I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account.
I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone.
I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit.
I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone.
Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST.
On the bright side, the return and my refund went smoothly but that's about it.
