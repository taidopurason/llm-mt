I didn't watch the CNN town hall, but it seems as if Trump said exactly the same things he says every time he opens his mouth or presses Send on his phone.
Even if he didn't get to say them during the town hall, everyone in America will hear them anyway, repeatedly, between now and November 2024.
That's still no reason to give him another venue, but the harm is being exaggerated.
He'll win the primaries.
We can't will him away.
He's here and he's going to say this stuff no matter what.
