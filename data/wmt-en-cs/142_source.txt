Someone screwed up the formula??
This is so weird.
In normal light it looks like I have a pink and an orange but under UV light they are the same!
I drew a pink line using a paint stick from another brand so you can see what pink should look like and know it's not just my camera.
Pink is my most used color so I'm a bit upset about this.
Red, orange, and pink are basically all orange.
No point in calling them red or pink.
The white isn't as bright as I would have hoped.
The rest of the colors are all great and I like how easily these paints wash off.
I just wits there were a pink.
I guess the purple will suffice.
