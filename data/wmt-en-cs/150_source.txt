Avoid Wifi connection- go Bluetooth!
I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017.
At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel.
I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel.
I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system.
March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect.
Every time I try, I get the error message.
Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit.
I followed the YouTube setup video with no success.
When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth).
Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone.
This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone!
I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection.
Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication.
I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.
