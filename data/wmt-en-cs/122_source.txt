(PERSON1) I mean the script that I have in two different folders, and then will run it with the little different inside workers, so that I mean, yeah, so that I have &lt;unintelligible/&gt; let's say ten, well instead of an output, a file by a &lt;unintelligible/&gt; side worker, so &lt;unintelligible/&gt; that we have, so I'll just make sure that these things for a single file are getting generated parallelly from all the available workers.
(PERSON1) Oh that would save our time.
(PERSON7) Yeah, yeah, this is very important to parallelize everything actually, parallelize both the processing of the systems as well as the evaluation of the cell DF, because he would need to run this many times, there will be errors, you need to re-run this quickly.
(PERSON7) Okay, so thanks.
So, you are very busy with this, I don't want to put any other things on you, so let me start with the reminders.
We need to finish the description of [PROJECT1] desk set,
Who do we have here?
Oh well, not really, yeah, (it's done) and it's not here unfortunately.
So, this would be for [PERSON2],
Then the evaluation, this is for [PERSON1], but we have discussed this.
Listen, give me the table in DSD let's put the fine line here and push the template of the table, like the plan structure into the delebl now, so that the numbers will come later, but I want to see some numbers and the full structure of the table very soon.
(PERSON7) Okay, thank you.
We have [PERSON5], that's good.
So, for [PERSON5], I would like to check what is the progress in the evaluation of the systems, and whether you are in touch with [PERSON1] also for the evolution, which is more important.
Can you hear us, [PERSON5]?
