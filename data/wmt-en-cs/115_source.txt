So, I plan to do it myself.
I plan to go there, but we need a backup person.
And also, for the [PROJEC210] event we need someone to take care of the recording,
So, the archiver person, so that we don't lose that session again.
And the more important and still persisting topic to work on is ladder climbing.
And I've suggested here in the paragraph for [PERSON2] that we could use simple html tables that would be autogenerated and that that would grow.
I think that that would be probably the easiest to just put up the tables as html, but it could get difficult when we want to see the differences, as new systems will be evaluated after every new evaluation campaign.
It may be difficult to prepare these tables.
So, I asked [PERSON7] and [PERSON7] unfortunately won't be available during this call.
To tell us whether [ORGANISATION242], which is a web-based solution.
Some start-up company which offers accounts for academic purposes for free.
If that would help us or not.
Okay, so [ORGANISATION242] is not recommended by [PERSON7].
So, simple html is probably the way to go.
So, as soon as [PERSON2] has these evaluations m cleaned up.
So, that means moving the few scripts to where they belong from [PROJECT3] test set and some automatic runner.
Then also please create a conversion from the tables into html similar to the tech conversion and then put these results regularly to your webpage.
Or what you could even do is to have a full git check out directly located in this public html or singling from that public html.
So that it would be immediately accessible through the web, and anybody could have a look at the current scorings and explore that.
So, this would be useful, especially for m people outside of [ORGANISATION2] such as, [ORGANISATION15].
We know they have like -
The performance was bad for some of the files, and they could directly m browse it on the web m.
They could also browse it actually in on [ORGANISATION101].
This is up to you to set it up so that it's user-friendly and easy to follow.
(PERSON2) Okay, I'll do that.
(PERSON11) Yeah, thanks.
I'm now working on, or getting to update, the demo paper submission, which is due next Friday, if I'm not mistaken.
And then I have some project reports to do and I'm starting to gather documents - like, or links to the documents, not the documents themselves yet, for the two sessions.
