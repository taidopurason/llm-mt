Rainy days!
Last week got a ton done and feeling much better about field items.
All collards, kale, chard is transplanted.
Plans to set in salad at Penn on 6row pattern and see how that compares to broadcast seeded beds.
Spring peas at Gilpin are showing up so trellise needs to be set.
Also need to seed a salad row there to integrate cut greens in both have trained crew on irrigation, bed prep, and transplanting which is 90% of non-harvest skill items
