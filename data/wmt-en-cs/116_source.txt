(PERSON11) &lt;parallel_talk&gt; For ASR as well we should add a complimentary metric -
Actually more, we should add complementary met- these complementary metrics. &lt;/parallel_talk&gt;
So, you mentioned one and that is profanity filtering m evaluation.
So &lt;parallel_talk&gt; have an explicit list of things which must not appear in the output &lt;/parallel_talk&gt;, right?
&lt;parallel_talk&gt; And then rare words evaluation.
And here have an explicit list of names and terms that we do want to appear in the output, scored not simply by (order) rate &lt;/parallel_talk&gt; but scored by something which directly accounts these things, right?
Yes, so I totally agree.
This involves also manual preparation of the reference.
So, &lt;parallel_talk&gt; both need manually created references. &lt;/parallel_talk&gt;
I have one remark from [PERSON1].
So &lt;parallel_talk&gt; [PERSON1] has compiled some translation dictionary.
And she should share it soon. &lt;/parallel_talk&gt;
So, this could become an empty part of the second thing of the rare word -
So &lt;parallel_talk&gt; this would be the rare word evaluation for MT and then from [PROJEC210] we are also likely to get some dictionary. &lt;/parallel_talk&gt;
So that would be the [PROJEC210] domain obviously.
And [PERSON2], could I ask you to revise the &lt;unintelligible/&gt; domain and create such a dictionary by looking at the outputs and what is missing in the outputs.
So, like shortlisting - listing the words that we do like, and we do not like in the &lt;unintelligible/&gt; domain.
Could you do that?
