Not like other tomb raider games
From the very beginning it did not feel like the other tomb raider games.
Gameplay is brutal in that controls aren’t smart in knowing what direction you’re trying to take.
Leaving you to fall to your death in the most redundant ways.
Puzzles are hard but not in a logical sense.
I have not enjoyed this game.
I do not plan on finishing it.
The story is lackluster as well which is the main reason I play games.
