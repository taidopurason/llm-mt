Ribbed off by Vision Supplies
October 2017 purchased four (4) cartridges from Vision Supplies - Amazon Marketplace, so I would have when needed and to save shipping cost.
Used two over the last couple of years, about one a year, and they worked okay.
Tried to use one last week, almost empty after printing 20 labels, but in last one ran out after 40 pages.
The plastic a missing on both.
Told warranty expired!!!!
Who would check every single cartridge when received????
BUYER BE AWARE!!!!!!!!!!!
