I'm tired of conservative parties and governments wrapping themselves in the brand of pro-business.
They aren't, at least not in Alberta.
Sure they cut business taxes.
But they also cut grants and tax credits that encourage more business activity.
I own a business. It's successful in spite of the provincial government, not because of it.
