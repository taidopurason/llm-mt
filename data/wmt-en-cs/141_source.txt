I put this on my nose as directed twice a day rubbing it in for 2 minutes.
The skin on my nose reddened and went completely raw.
I was pretty taken aback.
I had a well healed scar from falling into barb wire from years ago.
Not only did this product not work but I almost ended up at the dermatologist's office, however, putting aqua-for and a bandaid over the area finally calmed it down after about a week.
My nose is still reddened however but hoping this goes away soon.
