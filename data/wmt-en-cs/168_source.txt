I love many of the features of these lights
I purchased this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window.
I love many of the features of these lights.
Pros: First, they clamp easily onto my shelf, and bend to many positions allowing me to make changes as my plants grow.
The lights are cool to the touch, and haven't cause harm even when touching the plants.
I believe my veggies have benefited from the lights.
The lights are dimmable, but I use the strongest setting only.
I have not made use of the timer, preferring to turn them on and off myself.
I can see this feature as useful in an office setting with houseplants or if on vacation Cons: I do not believe these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for nursery plants.
The lights are small!
When the lights burn out, I will have to buy a whole new unit.
