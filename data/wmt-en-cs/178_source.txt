Ok case with serious limitations
This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max.
The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen.
Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues.
The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand.
The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments.
I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation.
This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy.
Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen.
The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen.
This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees.
This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand.
This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.
