I have a very drafty basement, which essentially means I can get a lot of rodents taking refuge.
There have been a lot of signs of more rodents this past month or so, which has been exceptionally surprising as it's spring and I would have thought they would venture outdoors with the change in weather.
Nonetheless, I've had a smattering of plain old snap-traps placed about, and would dutifully replenish the peanut butter on them every few days, as the mice kindly lick it clean.
I finally got fed up with this routine last night, cleaned all the traps of peanut butter, and superglued a pistachio to them.
It worked.
(fwiw, I've tried nearly every "humane" trap on the market with very little success.
I'm not especially happy with killing them, but I won't be taking comments on the ethics of killing mice.)
