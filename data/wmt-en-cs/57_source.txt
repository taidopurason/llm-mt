It's weird doing weightlifting but also having no real clue what your one-rep-max is, cus that's one of the key ways people track their progress.
I work out alone in my bedroom without a spotter or even a weight rack.
Just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights.
I bench press on my bed.
If I try and figure out my one rep max is I might not own enough weights to max out, or conversely it could seriously injure/kill me.
Anyway, load is going up today.
Still feels good.
