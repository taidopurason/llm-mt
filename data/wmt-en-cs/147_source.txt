Confusing storyline
The book was hard to keep up with as it jumped around a lot.
Also the title doesn’t fit the story.
The author indicated several people were infected by this alien, however left out may details on when or how it happened.
I was confused at times and had to go back and re read a lot to make sure I didn’t miss anything.
