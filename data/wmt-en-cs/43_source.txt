Casper the #rat is an absolute unit these days.
I think my new job has been good for him - two free roams a day while I work, at fairly predictable times.
I finally got a good dangle photo so I can be sure he's not fat.
(In #rats, too high body fat can be bad for their health.)
He's not.
He's just absolutely ripped from tearing around my office twice a day.
I don't have a scale to weigh him, but he feels like he's well over a pound.
It makes me so happy to see him thriving.
