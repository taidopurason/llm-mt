works for the most part
I had bleached my whole head and then dyed over it with a black box dye a few months ago.
I then went and had highlights put in all over my head.
A few weeks later I put blue/green Arctic Fox hair dye on my hair and it would not fade out.
I used this stuff with Olaplex No. 3 and it lightened TREMENDOUSLY all over, removing the green and blue parts as well as lifting the dark box dye.
However, after a day I noticed a green tint to my hair.
Every day it gets worse and I have used the color extractor twice now, with the same results.
My hair is also getting darker where the box dye was.
This is a great product it just doesn't seem to last.
