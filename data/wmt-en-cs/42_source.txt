Does you know of a performant way for a web component to respond to being added/removed from a document?
This is for Wikipedia's component library (OOUI).
It is mostly semantic HTML with CSS, and generally does not require custom elements (which offers connectedCallback).
We currently use a MutationObserver hack.
For performance, we don't observe the whole document.
We create a detached temp parent, install MO there, and observe it becoming detached (thus attached elsewhere).
