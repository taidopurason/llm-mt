I often wonder at the human capacity to be *so* down on oneself while inundated by so much evidence of what actual cruelty looks like.
To agonize over personal failure &amp; guilt in a world where "success" is so often bestowed on people responsible for the most reprehensible acts...
We're all such messy critters.
But gentling despair at our messiness is crucial - because it gives us more space to tackle the ruins all around.
So try not to forget, eh?
Kindness with ourselves is activism, too.
