Might be good on a pole, but NOT as a hanging baffle or weather shield.
Shame on Audubon.
The instructions tell you to push the plug up through the hole in the baffle and "Make sure it is securely in place."
HOW???
It is designed so that the baffle simply sits loosely on the plug, so that it can be pushed up by any critter or the slightest wind.
You can turn the plug upside down so that the thumb screws are on the underside of the baffle, but it will take you hours to turn those screws; no tool will do it, and only the tiniest fingers would have an easy time of it.
It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug.
It is a complete PITA.
I ordered four of these; the three that I didn't open are going straight back and I'm in the market for better weather guards.
(Let's face it; there's nothing like this which will actually "baffle" squirrels!)
