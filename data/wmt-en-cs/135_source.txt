Just as described
This is a basic puffer coat.
If you are seeking a basic coat, then this coat will meet expectations.
The coat arrived in a vacuum sealed bag so it needs to be hung up for a few days to let wrinkles come out and to "puff up" a bit.
I am 5 ft 6 inches and the coat is knee length on me.
I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed.
However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine.
There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later.
The hood functions, but no ties on it.
The front zipper works.
There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room.
There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you).
There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT.
For the price, I think it is fine.
I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold.
I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign.
However, I am curious how it will perform in the colder temps and in the rain/snow (supposed to be resistent).
Overall, I am pleased.
The vacuum seal bag can be re-used and the seller included a really cute thank you note which was a great touch.
