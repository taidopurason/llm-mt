buy the Pampered Chef...
I own a Pampered Chef small scoop, but am in between residences so most of my 'stuff' is in storage.
I love using these scoops while baking for perfectly portioned cookies.
I looked at the OXO scoop and the Pampered Chef scoop and decided to save some money and get the OXO one - I usually have good luck with their products.
Not this one.
At about peanut butter cookie #30 the lever inside the scoop stopped working.
I had to pry the handles apart and re-position the lever in order to do a few more, and then repeat.
So... save your sanity and buy the Pampered Chef scoop.
It's totally worth it!
