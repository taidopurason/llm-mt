Playing around a bit with Flutter.
I'd hate to base my business on tech from Google, to be honest, on the other hand Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create a compelling cross platform experience and it shows.
(And also: The Web is now largely a Google thing, unfortunately)
Also please refrain from telling me that google/flutter apps suck on iOS and macOS.
Cross platform is hard if you want to do it well.
I know that.
