So, I see this fair as an important possible source of non-native English speech that we can use to extend the test set.
So, I think we really should focus on the Clearest voice competition, and we can do the booth if we have to.
But I would like to limit that, because the dissemination into high school students is less of an impact for us.
It is more important to use it as a test session.
So, we should focus, [PERSON1], on the [PROJECT2] Clearest voice, and keeping the organizers happy so that we can do the data gathering there.
And do whatever they want us to do in exchange for that, and we need to check their plenary program, and what type of subtitling would be useful for that plenary program.
so that would make it a test session for us, and as for our own presence at this fair, I don't think it's too important.
So, if we are asked, if we are really expected to be there and present, then okay, but if not, then I think it's definitely good for us just to be behind the curtain and behind the scenes and do our job there.
(PERSON1) Yeah, I haven't tried to do the registration yet for that, but I think that last time, it was compulsory to have the booth.
(PERSON2) Yes. So, discuss with them what is needed so that they are happy, and they allow us to do the Clearest voice, which is the most important thing.
The test session is less of an urge.
And the booth is just something that we really could avoid, if possible.
