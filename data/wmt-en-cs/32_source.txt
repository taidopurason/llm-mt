Thank you to those people who have downloaded the latest update to Leasey.
A few very small difficulties have come to light.
Nothing to set alarm bells ringing but nevertheless they are being addressed.
A small update will be produced next week to correct them.
Most of yesterday was spent installing the new update for some customers, and everyone who does need that assistance should have received it by now.
Have a good day!
