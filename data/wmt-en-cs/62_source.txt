Have now done a full round trip on the new ICNG train.
I really like it.
Esp the carriages with the bigger windows.
There's areas that could use some polish.
Namely the lack of enough bins, and the lack of signs to explain the significance of the lighting colours.
Fix those minor issues, and then can we have more of these please?
I won't be sad to see the end of the ICM or DDZ stock.
