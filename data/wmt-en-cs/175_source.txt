I'm sorry, what?
My friend recommended the mask of this line so I bought that, this conditioner, and the all in one milk.
I cannot speak for the effectiveness of the product because the smell was just not tolerable.
You know that musty smell old buildings use in female restrooms to try to mask the smell of *ladies* but it just turns out as this sour, chemical, kind of musty grandma smell?
Ya that's all I can think of when I smell this.
You know different strokes different folks so maybe you'll like the smell.
My friend said it can help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about scent then no worries.
I know natural products aren't going to smell as pretty as some synthetic ones but I feel like more and more natural lines just care less since it will sell anyway and so now everything just smells like playdough.
I've lost a few favorite lines to them changing the formula to cheaper ingredients.
I don't know if that's the case here or if this is a fake (which I called Davines and they said it isn't) but this smells like Y U C K and I had to return it.
