BEWARE...SMELL IS VERY BAD...CARD SLOTS TOO BIG!
When I first saw this I thought it was beautiful, BUT it smelled SO BAD.
At first I thought it was the smell of leather, but many pointed out that is was a MOLD smell.
It never went away, so I had to return it.
PLUS, the pockets for the credit cards are too big.
The credit cards slide all the way down, the tips don't show so you have no idea what card is where and very difficult to get out.
THE PHOTO THEY SHOW WHERE THE CARDS ARE STICKING OUT IS INACCURATE.
