I swear burrata didn't exist five years ago
This is my personal Mandela effect thing.
I'd never seen it in a cookbook.
I'd never seen it at the fancy grocer or any of the Italian delis.
I'd never seen anyone's mom make it or had it shoved at me at a party or seen it appear in conjunction with anyone's saucemaking escapades or baking days
It just appeared one day and suddenly it was available everywhere.
I've entered the burrata dimension.
