Easy to install?????
Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase but it was not that easy for me to install.
I tried installing both "bells" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck.
I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells.
Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working.
After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase.
The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work.
It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly.
It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want.
One thing they ask in rating this bell is how "weatherproof" it is.
I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.
