You get what you pay for.
Horrible product, misrepresented
I bought this as a tracker to use while I swim, and I didn't even get a proper chance to try it.
First off, it's not water resistant and it is not recommended to use while swimming per the instruction manual.
Second, it doesn't come with a charger.
Instead, it suggests to use a USB plug or computer.
Fine, we have lots of those around.
When I try to get it into the port to charge it, however, it launches right back out.
I'm not sure if there's something not compatible or if this is just poorly made, but I'm not going to sit and hold my device in while it charges.
Lastly, the app keeps popping up ads, even when it's closed.
Ads popped up while I was sending a text, which is very concerning.
I then closed down all active apps on my phone, and saw yet another ad when I went to check the time 20 minutes later.
Horrible product, I guess I get what I paid for...
