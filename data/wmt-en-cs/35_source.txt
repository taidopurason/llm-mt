I was a voracious reader in my youth.
Then, life crushed my soul and I lost all my passion for fiction and great storytelling.
But, after ~decades~ of reading next to nothing (with the exception of functional work-related non-fiction stuff and an occasional self-help book) I set a goal to read 23 books in 2023.
I'm now on book # 31 and it's only May.
I'm BACK baby!
