Because for Interspeech, we could also like split it paper by paper.
So that some papers would go to the Interspeech proceedings.
And some of our submission papers would come later for the PBML proceedings.
And the authors would be free to choose.
So that we have to negotiate this with either SIGDial or Interspeech.
If it is okay for them to have some of our papers, given that these papers are submitted by the March deadline.
So, there is an absolute strict requirement.
And I think it's they cannot have anything against it.
Because if the paper is worth publishing.
Like, it's only a bonus that the paper has some shared task result appearing in the satellite event.
So yeah, I think it's okay.
So, we do not need to ask for a special session.
In Interspeech it is called special session, we don't want that.
In Interspeech we want the satellite event.
But we will tell our people.
If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, send it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it within Interspeech.
Ah, if you do not, ah, do it for the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline.
And that is for PBML.
(PERSON7) Ah, okay.
But the thing is like for Interspeech satellite event.
Erm, Interspeech like won't get into any proceedings.
