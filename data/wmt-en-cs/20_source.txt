One of the craziest parts about my neighbors turning against me is thinking about how much effort it takes to be hostile.
Forget me, fine.
Ignore me, fine.
It hurts but you gotta do you.
But at this point the open hostility and violence is getting worse.
That takes effort.
Slamming a door in my face takes effort.
Our dogs used to be BEST FRIENDS.
And I still have NO IDEA what I could have possibly done to deserve this.
They had keys to my apartment for 6+ years.
