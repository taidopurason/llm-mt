(PERSON1) and then, we'll figure out which packages to install in the Petri environment.
(PERSON7) Yeah, so there's another thing,
Maybe it's not a good idea to combine these two runs into one setup.
I think it is actually better if you run it separately and save the outputs.
So, you first use the environment for cruise control and the processing,
(PERSON7) and you collect all the output files, and then you run the evaluation.
And the reason for this split is that you can paralyze more.
So, there will be problems on various fronts, I'm sure, and we will need the numbers very soon.
So, if for example, some of the test files will fail for some reason,
Then you can still keep the translation running for the remaining ones,
and re-evaluate, with a sel T F, the missing ones, and, and so on.
So, it's, the point is not to create a serial, sequential processing that includes both,
but the point is to get the results, and it's actually better to do it in slices.
First get all outputs, then we get all evaluations.
(PERSON1) Yeah, so, I mean, right now, I was doing the same.
