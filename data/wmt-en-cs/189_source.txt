Ergonomic and affordable, but not very tolerant of constant use
It has a slimmer design shape that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to snag on and with the power cord as a permanent attachment, it's far less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller.
The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect that is triggered in action gaming feels much weaker.
2) The controller's directional joystick and buttons wear out very quickly.
We are very heavy handed and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year.
So for us, making investments in controllers yearly means we have to be picky and prudent about what we purchase.
The controller could do with more durable springs; after a couple months, buttons that are used the most stop responding and the right joystick loses it's centering, IE- makes map screens zoom in and characters walk forwards without even touching the controls.
