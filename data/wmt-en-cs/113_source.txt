(PERSON17) Anyone else can work on the non-native accent thing.
Ok, then another thing that I spotted is - this is in the Monday test document.
It is highlighted four times.
So, when some session is happening, we need the names and terminology for that session.
And we need to collect it, prepare it manually, create it somewhat.
And this manual creation should be supported with automatic tools as much as possible.
So, there is a certain skill b in that, which needs to be practiced.
So, I'm quite skilled at shuffling text files.
And whenever I see any of any of you doing that, then I like always have tips in my head of what could be done faster.
Maybe it is not faster for your end, but at least you should consider it.
So there this skill is something that that we need people to have.
And we need someone to be responsible for that.
And I'm afraid that the only person for this could be [PERSON8].
If you find anyone else who would be ready to help with the immediate domain adaptation, the data crunching, please say so.
And then we need -
So, once we have secured the dictionary of terms and whatever the word pronunciations, we need techniques to put these dictionaries to use in the systems.
So, my impression from the domain adaptation that [PERSON9] has been carefully doing for all the sessions was that it was not really visible in the hybrid ASR.
So, one such session is again going to happen this Monday.
[PERSON9] is already starting the data collection, but I would like to see the benefit of that domain adaptation in in in the [PROJECT5] set up.
So, maybe [PERSON9] and [PERSON8], because he's learning how to do domain adaptation and [PERSON14], because he is doing how to work with [PROJECT5].
If you three could meet and double check what is [PROJECT5] doing with the -
It's not [PROJECT5], actually, the domain adaptation is for the [PERSON18] toolkit, right.
