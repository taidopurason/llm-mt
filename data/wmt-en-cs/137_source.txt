Didn't work with my 1999 Buick LeSabre
Item arrived quickly and looked to be in good condition, even included battery pre-installed.
However, even though it should have been compatible with my 1999 Buick LeSabre, the remote failed to program or synchronize with the car.
The instructions are easy enough and I know that I was following them correctly because I was able to successfully re-program my old remote fob.
This new one, however, would not work and so I will be returning it.
There was no problem with the seller or service, it just seemed that this particular item was defective or incompatible with my vehicle.
