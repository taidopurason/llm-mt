I would have preferred them to join the sessions earlier than doing things like that.
So, we really need to practice these preparations.
With the online world, it seems that you simply j p into the session, and the work is done.
But that is not the case.
It always takes 30 minutes to get it running and properly connected.
So, we need to be there earlier.
And if some session that we are doing starts at nine, but the organizers meet at a quarter to nine.
Then we have to come at a quarter past eight already, so that we have the 30 minutes extra to make sure that everything is running and chase people.
So, this is a remark for everybody that for the management to work, please also anticipate what management might suddenly ask you to do, and that would help a little.
Another message that is very important is the recording of these important sessions.
I don't know if you have responded, I had not seen anyone providing any- any updates to the document.
Maybe I forgot to tell all of you.
I had a document about the experience from [PROJECT4]and [PROJECT5] 2020.
And the first point in this experience is that we were very bad at recording these sessions.
So, it's important for the purposes of further evaluation or analysis of what went wrong to have good recordings of these sessions.
And one aspect is to get the consents, to actually be allowed to do the recording.
And even if we try to get the consents in retrospect or whatever.
Then there is the technical aspect of the- of the recording.
And we have seen that this is so diverse and complex.
Yeah, [PERSON5] is sending that link.
I have sent it by email, I remember.
