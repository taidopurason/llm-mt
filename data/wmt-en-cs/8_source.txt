The next morning and I can't get past Chris Licht's disgraceful pretense of public service journalism on CNN last night.
It was an outrage, like a symbolic Jan 6 anti-democratic festivus of lies &amp; grievance, self-destructively hosted by American media.
THE SHAMEFUL AUDIENCE.
Licht AGREED to an all Republican audience!
Who vetted &amp; chose the individuals?
There's a story to be reported there.
The ratings--seeking delusional irresponsibility of it all.
It can't be repeated.
