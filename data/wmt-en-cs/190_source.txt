You get what you pay for
I was disappointed upon receiving this item as the silver part that goes around the face appeared to be made of some sort of cheap plastic.
It's not the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me as much as the fact that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap.
For me, this detail ruined the whole look for me.
I also did not trust it to hold up to everyday wear so I ended up returning it.
I was disappointed because it seemed like it would have been a good deal if it had not been for that.
However, it you can overlook that, then it might be right for you.
It was packaged well and did arrive quickly.
