... was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold
I asked the seller if the color was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold, darker.
Nothing close!
The set looks VERY cheap.
It's super shiny yellow with lots of CZs, even shinier.
Looks great on the photo, but in real life I wouldn't even give it to a teenager to wear.
