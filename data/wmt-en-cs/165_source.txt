Will not buy Mr. Coffee again
It was a fine coffee maker for a while, but there were always issues with it.
If you got water between the black plastic and metal on the carafe, it would leak and drain the water for days.
Then our plastic lever broke which allows the coffee to flow through the filter and into the carafe.
I contacted customer support to inquire about a new piece, but they would only refer me to a service center which is over 90 minutes from my house.
It's great at making coffee and keeping it hot, but there are too many other issues with it to invest in it at the current price.
