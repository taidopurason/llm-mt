He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors.
Regarding his portrayal of Churchill
Mr. Oldman has played and created many, different characters.
It is very difficult to tell it is him.
He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors.
Regarding his portrayal of Churchill, was very well done.
The compressed time frame from May 10 to the 26th was well presented with the clock 7 turning pages...
The scenery and costumes were excellent.
Is poignant with today's pair of demi-gods holding world political position.
Worth a look several times...worth thoughtful rumination... many more times
