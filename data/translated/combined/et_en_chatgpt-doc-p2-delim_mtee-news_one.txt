Judge: government general orders cannot be so extensive Government general orders, which have established various restrictions and rules during the coronavirus pandemic, should have a limited scope, said judge Ivo Pilving. "We referred to one limit, and the Tallinn Circuit Court has already referred to it, that the limit of government general orders - which today establish all the requirements for a corona pass - must eventually end. Because the nature of a general order is also that its legal scope must still be somehow limited. It cannot be as universally applicable as a law. And if it is not otherwise limited, such as for a certain group of individuals or something similar, then it must be limited in time," said Pilving, chairman of the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court, at a press conference held on Thursday. "I cannot take a position now whether that time has already passed today or will pass tomorrow or the day after tomorrow - these disputes are already in the courts and the truth will be revealed there. But somewhere there is also a limit for the government in using this instrument, and here the criticism of the appellants is to some extent correct, that the legislator cannot completely distance himself from these issues," Pilving continued. A government general order is a special type of administrative act, with which established restrictions can only be challenged in court by each individual separately, and the corresponding court decision does not apply to all objects of restriction, but only to the person who challenged it. The extensive use of general orders has been criticized by former Chancellor of Justice Allar Jõks. At the same time, the judge emphasized that the dispute, in relation to which the Supreme Court announced its decision on Thursday, is different. "It concerns one - albeit a very special one - institution, the defense forces - and here the legal framework is somewhat looser, because it does not concern everyone. It concerns Estonian men and women working in the defense forces, and according to the current understanding, the head of the respective institution can also establish requirements for a limited group of individuals based on the Occupational Health and Safety Act," said Pilving. He explained that the Supreme Court's previous practice indicates that the more extensive, deep, and intensive a restriction or obligation is, the more work the parliament must do with it. "Up to the point that some obligations are such that they must be finally regulated by law," the judge noted. "But on the other hand, the topic of vaccination and the pandemic, which comes in waves and requires quick response, speaks in favor of executive decision-making authority and government decision-making authority. And even when we talk about institutions and the requirements [imposed on] the people working in them, according to the current understanding of the Supreme Court, there is room for the orders of the leaders of those institutions, if the conditions are met," he added.
French fishermen block traffic in the English Channel to demand fishing rights French fishermen will block ferry traffic in three ports in the English Channel on Friday to demand post-Brexit fishing rights, as well as commercial traffic in the tunnel between France and the UK, the union said. Gerard Romiti, chairman of the French National Committee for Fisheries (CNPMEM), described the protest as a warning shot and said that traffic will be blocked in the ports of Saint-Malo, Ouistreham, and Calais, as well as in the Eurotunnel, for several hours. The long-standing dispute between the UK and France over fishing permits remains unresolved and threatens to escalate into a full-scale trade war. "We don't want donations, we just want our permits back. The United Kingdom must respect the post-Brexit agreement," said Romiti. "We have held our breath for 11 months. The patience of professionals has its limits. We hope that this warning shot will be heard," he said, without ruling out further measures. France has threatened to prohibit British fishing vessels from unloading their catch in French ports and impose stricter controls on all British imports. According to President Emmanuel Macron, such measures are expected to provide an opportunity for negotiations, but French officials emphasize that all options are still on the table. Negotiations between French Minister for European Affairs Clement Beaune and British Brexit Minister David Frost have so far been fruitless. According to last year's agreement between the UK and the European Union, European fishing vessels can continue to fish in British waters if they can prove that they have done so in the past. Paris claims that the applications of dozens of French ships have been unjustifiably rejected. London denies this.
The basketball team lost to Germany by four points at halftime. The Estonian men's basketball team starts the 2023 World Cup qualifying series by facing Germany away. ERR's sports portal will provide live coverage of the match starting at 8 PM. Vene bounces long and looks for a spot, finally drawing a foul from Benzing. This is the fourth for the experienced German, but both teams now have full fouls four minutes before the end of the game. Heckmann misses both free throws. 4.20 left, Germany leads 61:58, but Jurkatamm fouls Heckmann on the shot. Veideman breaks very well and Estonia finally earns two more points from the game situation. Veideman misses a three-pointer, but Sengfelder also misses from under the basket and then fouls Nurger. Jurkatamm comes to help in defense excellently and the ball stays with Estonia. Doreth misses from deep, but Treier commits his fourth foul in the rebound battle. Two out of one, 5.50 before the end of the game, Germany ahead 61:56.
Vambola Paavo | Let's establish a maximum price for gasoline, following the example of Hungary A month ago, I happened to listen to the radio show "The Prime Minister is in the Studio". When the reporter asked Kaja Kallas how much a liter of fuel costs at gas stations, there was silence. The Prime Minister hesitantly replied, "I don't know." At a time when energy carriers are becoming more expensive worldwide, how can the head of government not know how much something costs! Therefore, he has out-of-touch and bad advisors. In contrast, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban knows very well. Hungary has fixed fuel prices for three months at the national level. They must not exceed 500 forints or 1.42 euros per liter at gas stations. Currently, the fixed price for three months is 480 forints or 1.37 euros per liter. Prices are reviewed every three months. The upper limit was prompted by accelerated inflation, which is the highest in the country in nine years - 6.5 percent. According to the decision, gas station chains can sell at a lower price, but not at a higher price.
CHINESE MEDICINE RECOMMENDS: this plant should now be in every home! During the autumn-winter season, when it is damp and humid outside, it is necessary to strengthen and warm the body. For this purpose, several medicinal plants are suitable, which keep the warmth inside but do not allow excessive heat to develop. It is very convenient to put both the plants and hot water in a thermos, take it to work or school, and drink supportive tea throughout the day, as recommended in the Health Alchemy blog. When the tea runs out, hot water can be added to the plants several times.
TALLINN REMOTE LEARNING WAS POINTLESS! Testing in schools yielded the same result! The four-week remote learning for grades 4-8 in Tallinn schools did not give the city an advantage in combating the coronavirus, as rapid tests achieved comparable results in areas with open schools, according to dry figures. Remote learning also took place in Pärnu for a shorter period of time and partially in Narva, but in Tallinn it started immediately after the school break and lasted for a full four weeks. For scientists analyzing the coronavirus, an excellent basis for comparison has now emerged: Tallinn versus the rest of Estonia. After future national exams, for example, it will be possible to observe whether four weeks of absence from school also means poorer results compared to the rest of the country. But for now, the most important question is whether Tallinn's decision to switch municipal schools to long-distance learning has brought the city greater success in the fight against the coronavirus. Due to the actions of Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, friction arose between Toompea and downtown.
ANU SÄÄRITS HONESTLY ABOUT LIFE: objectivity and courage to stand tall are important, and not to underestimate oneself or others Anu has inherited from her childhood home the knowledge that no matter what, one must manage. "I come from a large family. In our family, my mother practically took care of five children alone, we couldn't make any demands. I had to grow up quickly to somehow realize my interests." Curiosity has been the driving force for Anu Säärits (49), familiar from sports news and broadcasts, truly since childhood. "Quite early on, I saw that hey, something interesting is happening in Tallinn! I decided to go there from Tartu by hitchhiking, see what it's about, and only tell my family when I got back," the woman chuckles about her determination at the time, which repeatedly led her to explore further.
Mart Seim: I am the only super heavyweight weightlifter who has not been caught using banned substances at the Rio Olympics. Estonia's most successful weightlifter Mart Seim and his colleague Leho Pent are preparing for the upcoming World Championships in two weeks. If their favorite discipline remains in the Olympic program, both of them want to compete at least until the 2024 Paris Games. Their aspirations for the Tokyo Olympics this summer were dashed by the coronavirus they contracted in the spring, which confined both Mart and Leho to their sickbeds and prevented them from regaining their athletic form for the European Championships.
Reader's letter | Cry for help: only wiggling legs were visible from the shopping cart A man rescued a child who had gotten stuck between the groceries in the shopping cart. Is a child even supposed to be in the shopping cart?! "I was on my weekly shopping trip and was turning between the cold counters when two wiggling legs appeared in front of my eyes. At first, I didn't understand what was happening, but then I realized that there was a child in the shopping cart. I can't say for sure, but it's likely that the little one was trying to crawl out feet first from between the piles of food. Or maybe they had just gotten uncomfortably stuck between the groceries and were trying to adjust themselves," describes Siim the scene that unfolded in the store.
Poeta Santa Claus' gift bag with nuts from a domestic nut producer Candies, various candy bars, and chocolate bars - seems like a typical choice for Santa Claus' gift bag or a Christmas stocking? In reality, these are not healthy at all. Instead, one could delight a child or a loved one during the Christmas period with something healthy. Different nuts, almonds, and seeds are beneficial for health. Some might raise an eyebrow, saying that nuts also contain a lot of fats - can't they be equated with candies then? No, definitely not. If you look at the label on a package of nuts, you can read that the fats in nuts consist almost entirely of healthy and essential unsaturated fatty acids, with a small amount of saturated fatty acids and no trans fats at all. Fats are beneficial for our bodies and should not be completely avoided. However, it is important to prefer unsaturated fatty acids, or good fats, which can be found in nuts, seeds, and almonds. Therefore, the only Estonian nut producer, Germund Hulgi, recommends choosing healthy snacks during the Christmas holidays. Germund Hulgi's black Premium packages, which contain the largest nuts and dried fruits, are especially popular. For example, peanuts come from Georgia, almonds from California, raisins and cranberries from Chile, and cashews from Vietnam. Roasting, salting, mixing into delicious blends, and packaging, however, takes place in Estonia.
Baltic stock market sees moderate rise today Compared to November 24th, the Tallinn stock market has risen by 0.19%. The stock price of Bercman Technologies has experienced a noticeable drop. On the Baltic First North list, the stock of Bercman Technologies has fallen from 9 euros to 8.6 euros in the last day, which means a decrease of 4.44%. Compared to the drop on November 24th from 11.4 euros to 9 euros (-21.05%), the stock price of Bercman is currently stabilizing. Even ELMO Renti's stock has gone into decline after good news at the beginning of the week. As of today, the stock has fallen to 5.03 euros (-2.9%). On the other hand, K2 LT is rising on the Baltic First North to 31.2 euros (2.63%), and MADARA Cosmetics also saw a slight increase to 28.2 euros (0.71%). In the Baltic main list, the biggest gainers of the day are Panevezio statybos trestas at 0.7 euros (5.74%) and SAF Tehnika at 12.5 euros (3.73%).

792 euros for just one set! In the new gymnasium in Kohtla-Järve, extremely expensive coat hangers are being purchased with state funds. In the list of tangible expenses of the Kohtla-Järve Wiru sports center, which was opened this year, the cost of the hangers needed in the gymnasium changing room stands out. The director of the sports center justifies the high cost of the hangers by saying that they want to be the most modern.
"You can't say that I'm not a woman." An exceptional sprinter girl, who ran 100 meters from a flying start in 9.86 seconds. Naturally high in testosterone, Namibian sprinters Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi exceed the usual limits and raise new questions. During the Tokyo Olympics, Estonians were able to cheer for Maicel Uibo's wife, Shaunae Miller-Uibo, as she successfully defended her title in the 400-meter race. The victory was overwhelming, but to be fair, all possible challengers dropped out for one reason or another, and the slender Bahamian had to win. Figuratively speaking, the path to the gold medal was swept clean. Two years earlier, at the Doha World Championships, Bahrain's quarter-miler Salwa Eid Naser surprisingly took first place ahead of Miller-Uibo, but she was later punished for missing doping tests. A new super talent, 19-year-old Athing Mu, who grew up in America, chose the 800m distance and became the Olympic champion. And this year, the teenage Namibian sprinters (Christine Mboma ran 48.54 and Beatrice Masilingi ran 49.53) were banned from participating in the 400m distance by the World Athletics (WA) due to their high testosterone levels. But what will happen next? Mboma and Masilingi, who came second and sixth in the 200m distance in Tokyo, still provoke disagreements. It seems like no one is satisfied. Some believe they have been discriminated against, while others believe that this duo should not compete in women's events at all. The issue requires a solution as quickly as possible, as observers say it is only a matter of time before Mboma, with a very poor start but unprecedented speed, starts setting world records.
The government made an exception: more spectators will be allowed for the Estonia-Israel qualifying match The government considered the men's basketball World Cup qualifying match between the national teams of Estonia and Israel, which will take place in Saku Suurhall in Tallinn this Sunday, as events of overwhelming public interest and allows up to 3360 spectators for the match. According to the current restrictions, indoor sports events can have up to 1000 spectators starting from November 15th. The Health Board supports the event taking place with an increased number of spectators if the organizer mitigates the risk of COVID-19 transmission according to the submitted plan, the government announced on its website. The spectators would be divided into four zones in Saku Suurhall and would not come into contact with each other, the players, or the game-serving staff. Access to the event is only granted upon presenting a COVID certificate, and mask-wearing will be checked on-site. The sectors are designed in a way that people are spread out, and separate ventilation is provided for each area. The use of horns and similar items is prohibited. The Estonian Basketball Association advises spectators to arrive in a timely manner to avoid queues during the verification of certificates and documents at the entrance. The doors will open one hour before the start of the event. A total of 14 different entrances will be open for the four levels. The Estonian national team will start the 2023 World Cup qualifying series on Thursday evening, facing Germany in Nuremberg. Tickets for the Sunday match against Israel can be purchased from Piletitasku.
The food had already been ordered and the invitations sent: the Finns decided to cancel the presidential ball at the last moment. The Finnish President's Office announced today that for the second year in a row, the traditional presidential ball will be cancelled on Independence Day. The decision was made practically at the last moment, as the event was supposed to take place on December 6th. This means that a lot of working hours have already been dedicated to organizing the ball. Some time ago, invitations were sent out and drinks and food were also ordered. According to the Office, nothing will go to waste, as they can be used for future events. The invitations that have already been sent out will also be valid next year, writes Iltalehti. "The preparations for the reception took into account the small number of guests, so fewer things were reserved for the event," said the Office representative. The reason for the cancellation of the ball is the same as last year. Namely, there is concern about the increase in coronavirus infections. However, President Sauli Niinistö and First Lady Jenni Haukio have found a way to celebrate Independence Day with their people. On December 6th, the President and the First Lady will give an interview to Yle directly from the palace. Several well-known musicians will also perform as part of the same broadcast.
Great example: Anett Kontaveit doesn't sit idle during her vacation and helps those in need. After a tiring tournament in Mexico, Estonia's top tennis player took a short break and rests in her homeland. But during this time, she helps those who need assistance. Anett Kontaveit doesn't just rest idly, but makes practical use of this time. She posted pictures on Instagram, calling herself a "plant mom" and growing plants that bring greenery to her home. She also engages in charity work, raising awareness about the activities of the Animal Shelters Association. Anett posted pictures of dogs on social media, saying that she will also help them this year. At a press conference on Monday, Anett Kontaveit said that she has considered setting a goal of winning a Grand Slam tournament. "I've been thinking about it for a couple of days. Of course, my dream is to win a Grand Slam, but the most important thing is that the goals are based on development. I want to improve my game and certain tennis elements, as well as my physical condition. If this development process is positive, better results will come," she said through Delfi Sport. Kontaveit thanked the fans who stayed up late in recent weeks to support her during her matches in Mexico: "It has been very heartwarming to see how many people have been rooting for me. I have received so much positive feedback and I am very grateful to everyone who cares about what I do. I also want to thank my supporters and sponsors, without whom I wouldn't have come this far." After a short rest, Kontaveit will start preparing for the new season in Tallinn and will fly to a warmer place to acclimatize as the Australian tournaments approach.

Singer Jessie J lost a child: I lack control over my emotions The famous musician recently broke up with her partner, Max Pham, but decided to carry the pregnancy to term and raise their child together as a single mother. Unfortunately, during a recent check-up, doctors were unable to detect the baby's heartbeat, Jessie J revealed in a post on Instagram. "Yesterday morning, I laughed with a friend, asking them: 'Seriously, how am I going to do the performance in LA tomorrow night without telling the whole audience that I'm pregnant?'," the singer wrote. "But by lunchtime, I was battling with the thought of how I would manage the performance without collapsing. During the third check-up of the pregnancy, I was told that the baby's heart was no longer beating. This morning. I feel like I lack control over my emotions. I might regret making this post later. I really don't know." Despite being in deep mourning, the woman has decided to go ahead with her performance in Los Angeles, believing that it will help her. "I want to sing tonight. Not because I'm avoiding grieving or the whole process, but because I know that singing tonight will help me," she said. "I've only done two concerts in the past two years, and my soul needs this. Today more than ever. I know that some people will say that I should cancel it, but right now one thing is clear to me. I started singing at a young age because it makes me happy, fills my soul, and acts as therapy. That hasn't changed, and I have to go through things in this way." Jessie J revealed that she decided to raise the child alone because she was very much looking forward to becoming a mother. She knows that life is short and that getting pregnant was a miracle and an experience she will never forget. She hopes to be able to get pregnant again in the future, but for now, she is still in shock and extremely sad. "But I know that I am strong and I know that everything will be okay," she added. "I also know that millions of women around the world have felt this pain and even worse."
Make small footprint candles yourself Whoever pours candles before the holidays, try Nordic and natural rapeseed wax. Wax made from rapeseeds is a renewable and environmentally friendly raw material. It's time for the annual candle making season. Candles can also be made in spring and summer, but this activity is especially suitable for autumn. It's dim and rainy outside, the wind is blowing. At the same time, candle wax is melting in a pot on the stove and the room is filled with wonderful aromas. These are magical moments. Our ancestors made candles from valuable sheep fat and they were only used on special occasions. Today, there are many different materials and tools available for making candles. Navigating through them can be confusing.
A new strange beauty trend is spreading on TikTok: women are using lubricant as a makeup primer. TikTok users are once again introducing a new beauty trend, recommending replacing the makeup primer in your cosmetic bag with the lubricant used in the bedroom.
Johannes Vares's sad fate: was it suicide or was he eliminated from life? Did Johannes Vares shoot himself mainly to be quicker than death? Or was he forced or scared into suicide? Or was he eliminated from life because he resisted not physically, but mentally... Peeter Olesk reflects on Vares-Barbarus's life and death in his latest piece. When Johannes Vares, also known as Johannes Barbarus (Jan. 12, 1890 - Nov. 29, 1946), was found dead in his Kadriorg official apartment's bathroom early in the morning, he certainly didn't shave with a pocket knife, but most likely with a razor, some cream, and a shaving brush. This morning toilet couldn't have been difficult or painful, as he probably shaved every day, but of course he had various colognes by the mirror and liquids to erase the bloody traces of cuts. The question is whether he wrote two pre-death letters before going in front of the mirror or after, with his chin already shaved. The answer to the posed question would help us understand at what time Johannes Vares lost sleep on the day of his death, how much time he had to write farewell letters, and where he did it. A writing desk, white sheets of paper, an ink pot, and a quill are not ordinary things in a bathroom! It takes about an hour to write two quite long and extremely personal letters. Shaving, brushing teeth, and rinsing the mouth could take about twenty minutes, but what Johannes Vares couldn't know was the length of time that would pass before he would be searched for and who would find his dead body first. Considering these circumstances, I am inclined to believe that the farewell letters were ready before death arrived, at the latest on the previous evening. Therefore, they were written consciously, not impulsively. According to a verbal message from Nigol Andersen, Johannes Vares did not want to live as a disabled person at the end of his life. From this, one could conclude that he knew the course of his illness. However, the word "disabled" may not necessarily mean a visibly noticeable disability, it can also mean loss of work capacity or being released from work for health reasons as an excuse.
In Nõmme, a stack of books hid a murder victim. The case is in the hands of the "cold murder" investigators. In 2019, the police received an unusual call to Lemmiku Street in Nõmme: during the renovation of an old house, it was discovered that a dead body had been hidden under a neatly stacked pile of books in one of the rooms. How is that possible? The investigators have visited an elderly lady twice, but there hasn't been a clear moment yet to catch her answering the question. The lady may hold the key to one murder: according to a source, she once said years ago that her son might be guilty of a crime.
Gas instead of brakes. Controversial factory laid cornerstone despite ongoing legal dispute. Government members said they will not start building the factory until a court decision is made, this summer. However, the oil factory received approval to lay the cornerstone from ministers last Tuesday. On November 16, Eesti Energia laid the cornerstone for the Enefit280 oil shale plant, for which the government allocated 125 million euros of taxpayer money, and which climate activists took to court. Those who pay attention will remember that just half a year earlier, the Tartu Circuit Court suspended the construction permit for the factory, and Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that Eesti Energia was given a clear message: the construction of the plant must be halted until the end of the legal dispute. However, in November, Eesti Energia pushed the gas pedal and started construction. Legally, Eesti Energia does indeed have the right to start building the plant, as in early June, the Tartu Circuit Court lifted the construction ban on the oil plant. However, the company took a business risk by laying the cornerstone for the plant, as the dispute over the legality of the construction permit is still ongoing. "In the event that the buildings and facilities of the plant are erected by the end of the legal dispute, but the complaint is upheld and the construction permit is declared invalid, the further course of action will depend on the reasoning of the courts. It is entirely possible that the buildings will be deemed illegal, and theoretically, there is a possibility that they will have to be demolished," explained Kärt Vaarmari, a lawyer at the Center for Environmental Law.
The only Australian in Lääne County teaches Estonians to eat grass Matthew Hill, who moved from Australia to Estonia, together with his wife Piret, established an organic sprout plantation in Jaagu farm in Lääne County. The family grows about ten different types of sprouts there all year round and received the title of the best organic producer. Check out what else is discussed in the latest issue of Maaleht! Matthew Hill, who moved from Australia to Estonia, together with his wife Piret, established an organic sprout plantation in Lääne County. On their vegetable beds, the owner practices sustainable agriculture, which is already very popular in other parts of the world: the beds are not dug, only lightly aerated. The Hill family's innovative ideas and practices in vegetable farming have attracted attention, and they received the title of the best organic producer this year.
German scientists are teaching cows to use the toilet. The results could change the world. A small herd of cows in Germany has learned an impressive habit. They use a fenced area with artificial turf as a toilet. But why is such training necessary? Around 10% of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity worldwide come from cows. German scientists are trying to develop an unbelievably seeming solution to make cattle farming more environmentally friendly.
Prosecutor on the case of the man who killed a woman: he regretted his actions and voluntarily sought help. On Wednesday, we wrote about the case where Kiur, who mistreated a woman and accidentally caused her death, was sentenced to two years in prison with a three-year and three-month probation period. This means that as of now, the man would only have to spend two days behind bars. According to District Prosecutor Kelly Kruusimägi, such a punishment is justified because Kiur regretted his actions and voluntarily sought help for his problems. We publish the prosecutor's comment. "The evidence collected during the pre-trial investigation established that Kiur hit the woman once in the face and the victim's death occurred approximately two days later. The evidence confirms that the woman communicated with Kiur immediately after the blow and in the following two days. The woman left the apartment the next day, moved around, and according to Kiur's statements, he did not realize that the woman may have suffered a health injury that could be dangerous and require medical intervention. Considering the entire event, this is plausible because as an alcohol abuser, the woman may have had certain coordination disorders while moving around normally. Furthermore, the victim was not bloody or complained about anything unusual after the blow. Therefore, we did not establish an intention to kill, and the evidence did not indicate a desire to cause life-threatening health damage. Kiur does not have any valid criminal convictions. He admitted to hitting the victim and regretted his actions and the fact that he did not realize the need to call an ambulance. He voluntarily sought help for his alcohol problem and is employed. Taking into account all these circumstances, but primarily the specific act and the man's previous behavior, the prosecution requested a two-year prison sentence, which will not be enforced if Kiur does not commit a new crime during the longer probation period of three years and three months. The probation period is a period in which a person must prove that they will live lawfully in the future, which is one of the goals of the punishment. All parties, including the victim's mother, agreed to this solution and she also stated that she does not believe that Kiur intended to cause the woman's death."
Day in traffic: Three vehicles were involved in an accident in the center of Tallinn. Yesterday morning, three cars were involved in an accident in the center of Tallinn, one of which was parked on the street. At 9:53, a traffic accident occurred at the intersection of Pronksi Street and Gonsiori Street in Tallinn, where, according to preliminary data, a 38-year-old man was driving an Audi R8 and collided with an Audi Q7 driven by a 44-year-old woman. As a result of the collision, the Audi R8 hit a stationary Ford Tourneo. The driver of the Audi Q7 was taken to East Tallinn Central Hospital. The exact circumstances of the accident are being investigated. At 15:20, a 48-year-old woman driving a Mercedes-Benz in Võru city hit a 75-year-old woman who was crossing the road near house 46 on Jüri Street. The driver took the pedestrian to Võru Hospital for examination. During the past 24 hours, one driver under the influence of drugs and one driver under the influence of alcohol were caught. A 2004 gray Volvo V40 with license plate 789BSN was stolen from the jurisdiction of the Southern Prefecture.
Ülo Kalm: a new powerful hospital was promised in the elections. The money comes from Brussels, but where will the workers and equipment come from? How can the mayor, whose father is Ülo and mother is Liidia, manage the leadership of a multicultural city? Sad-funny was the former mayor Savisaar's belief that trust is eternal and he presented himself as a candidate again. The star had faded. The election result in Narva shows that trust is already more important than language and nationality. Doctors must fight against charlatans who offer opinions instead of facts in the name of trust. In addition, gentlemen who do not trust our hospital system have also appeared in the spotlight (more precisely, in the newspaper columns). I just read a confession of a gentleman from the city about his experiences in PERH.
Alo Raun: congratulations, 55% supports the cohabitation law! 55% - according to opinion polls, there is an absolute majority support for the cohabitation law today, when looking at Estonian citizens aged 18 and older who have an opinion on this matter. These are people who can also vote in the parliament and participate in referendums. This is revealed by the consolidated results of the surveys conducted by Norstat and commissioned by the Liberal Citizen Foundation in September and October. According to the same survey, this trend has been ongoing for a long time. So when we talk about what "the people want", it is no longer correct to say that we/they are against the cohabitation law.
A new and "truly terrifying" variant of the coronavirus, B.1.1.529, has been detected in Botswana. A new variant of the coronavirus, B.1.1.529, with as many as 32 spike protein mutations, has been identified in Botswana, and it is not yet known whether existing antibodies in humans can effectively respond to it. So far, only a handful of infections with this variant have been recorded through sequencing - three in Botswana, six in South Africa, and one in Hong Kong. Therefore, scientists hope that the COVID cases caused by the new virus variant are not widely spread, writes Sky News. Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London, described the abundance of mutations found in the variant as "truly terrifying". Spike proteins are the ones that viruses use to enter human cells, and the principle of most vaccines is to train the human body to recognize and neutralize them. Therefore, spike protein mutations may prove problematic for mRNA vaccines. Francois Balloux, a professor at the University of London, said that the new variant should be carefully monitored and its spread analyzed. "But there is no reason to be overly concerned, unless its frequency increases in the near future," he said. The professor added that the abundance of mutations in B.1.1.529 may be due to it "evolving in a person with immunodeficiency during a chronic illness, perhaps an untreated HIV/AIDS patient". The first cases of infection with this variant were detected in Botswana on November 11th, and in South Africa three days later. In Hong Kong, a 36-year-old man was found who had a negative PCR test before flying from Hong Kong to South Africa, where he stayed from October 22nd to November 11th. He tested negative upon returning to Hong Kong, but on November 13th, the test result was already positive. The Guardian reports that some South African virologists are already concerned, especially considering the recent increase in cases in Gauteng, where B.1.1.529 cases have been detected. Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge, told the publication that his laboratory found that two mutations in B.1.1.529 increased the virus's infectivity and reduced its recognition by antibodies.
European Commission: vaccination certificates valid for travel for 9 months, indefinitely after booster dose The European Commission has recently proposed to member states to establish deadlines for the validity of vaccination certificates for travelers between European Union countries. According to the proposal, the standard validity period for vaccination certificates issued after the initial vaccination cycle should be at least 9 months. This means that member states should not refuse to recognize a vaccination certificate confirming that less than 9 months have passed since the administration of the last dose of the initial vaccination. As for booster doses, according to the Commission's proposal, the 9-month validity period should not apply to certificates issued after the booster dose. This means that, at least initially, certificates obtained after the booster dose should be valid indefinitely. "It is possible that protection lasts longer after the booster dose than after the initial vaccination, so the Commission is closely monitoring new scientific data on this issue. Based on this, the Commission may later propose to establish an appropriate validity period for vaccination certificates issued after the booster dose," the Commission noted. To allow sufficient time for the implementation of the new rules, the Commission proposes to start applying the updates from January 10, 2022. Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders stated at today's press conference that only vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency will be accepted, so, for example, certificates issued in Hungary where people have been administered the Russian Sputnik or Chinese vaccines do not apply. Over 650 million vaccination certificates have been issued in the EU to date. The Commission also found that individuals with a valid EU digital COVID certificate should not be subject to testing, quarantine, or other additional restrictions, regardless of the EU region they arrive from. For individuals without an EU digital COVID certificate, travel could be allowed based on a test conducted before or after arrival. The EU traffic light system will be updated as follows: the number of new cases will be considered together with the vaccination rate in the region. No restrictions should be applied to travelers arriving from green areas. On the other hand, for dark red areas, given the high number of infections, it is recommended to avoid travel in both directions, and travelers who are not vaccinated or have not had the disease should be required to undergo testing and quarantine. Exceptions should be made for cross-border commuters, children under 12, and people with essential travel needs. According to the Commission, the list of people with essential travel needs should be limited, as many of the currently listed travelers have had the opportunity to get vaccinated in the meantime.
Chinese company: the parliament adopted a discriminatory and competition-damaging law Chinese technology company Huawei does not hide the fact that it does not like the electronic communications law adopted by the parliament yesterday - it gives the executive power the opportunity to discriminate against entrepreneurs based solely on the location of their headquarters in the country. "Based on the law, it can be assumed that obtaining a license for the hardware and software of a manufacturer from a country outside the European Union, NATO or OECD may be significantly more difficult than for a manufacturer whose headquarters are located in the member states of the aforementioned organizations," said Ben Chang Bin, the head of Huawei Technologies Estonia. According to Huawei's statement, the presumed association of the hardware and software used in the communication network with a specific country is not justified, as all large companies operate internationally and their supply chains are similar to each other. According to the company, technology security can also be ensured through "transparent and proportional measures, avoiding unjustified discrimination of market participants and without damaging competition". According to the new version of the Electronic Communications Act, the Building Code Act and the State Fees Act, the government has the right to impose an obligation on a communication service provider to apply for a license for the use of communication network hardware and software in order to ensure national security. This license is also issued through security authorities. The ban applies to cases of hardware and software for which the list is so long that it is unlikely that there is a country or manufacturer in the world that could meet the requirements set by Estonia. For example, it is sufficient that the company has supply difficulties, a cyber attack has been organized from its home country, or some of its products have security vulnerabilities. The manufacturer's location or headquarters is in a country that is not a member of the European Union, NATO or OECD. The manufacturer's home country does not adhere to the principles of a democratic rule of law or respect human rights. The manufacturer's home country does not protect the intellectual property, personal data or trade secrets of another country. The manufacturer's home country behaves aggressively in cyberspace. The manufacturer's home country has been subjected to cyber attacks by EU, NATO or OECD member states. The manufacturer is subject to the government or state authority of the home country or another foreign country without independent judicial control. The manufacturer's home country or another foreign country may require it to act in a manner that endangers the security of the Estonian state. The manufacturer's economic activity is not based on market-based competition or sufficient conditions have not been created for it in the home country. The ownership structure, organizational structure or management structure of the manufacturer is not transparent. The financing of the manufacturer is not transparent. The manufacturer's products or services contain security vulnerabilities and sufficient security measures have not been implemented to eliminate them. The manufacturer is not consistently able to ensure the delivery of products or services, except in cases of force majeure. Following the decision of the parliament, Estonia can finally announce the auction of 5G frequencies to telecommunications companies. Estonia is currently the last in the European Union in terms of the introduction of 5G.
Mihkel Raud on corona speculations in social media: it's like 15 minutes of fame, on which it's easy to elicit sympathy from others "Life is what happens when you have other plans," said a wise man once. This man was probably John Lennon. Although we tend to attribute brilliant quotes to people we like the most, so it may happen that someone else said those wise words instead of Lennon. But the essence of the sentence changes very little from that. I had beautiful plans. I had to perform with Singer Vinger in Sindis, then take the bus back to Tallinn and participate in the "Estonian Idol" final show the next day - exactly as I had performed, traveled, and participated countless times over the past dozen years. But life got ahead of my plans. "I don't feel very well, maybe we should go straight to the city?" I tried to persuade Singer Vinger's companions to give up another forest stop. We had already done three of them. The bus turned into the forest, the men smoked outside, and I felt the fever rising every second. And if you now think that you have stumbled upon another COVID rant, you are only partly right.
Family doctor warns: flu is circulating! This is a serious illness, it's not just a cold and cough. How to protect yourself? There is a lot of talk about the coronavirus, its prevention and treatment. In comparison, it tends to be forgotten that during the autumn-winter season, there are many different respiratory viruses circulating, and the flu has already reached Estonia, so it is high time to protect yourself from the virus, says the head of Laagri Family Doctor Center and family doctor Triinu-Mari Ots, giving advice on recognizing and preventing the flu. The typical Estonian autumn-winter season of coughs, colds, and sore throats has begun, mainly caused by various viruses that cause acute respiratory infections of the upper respiratory tract. "The most common causes are rhinovirus, RS virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza. The general term for these diseases is acute respiratory viral infections, and specific symptoms such as cough, sore throat, runny nose, or headache are treated," says Triinu-Mari Ots. An exception is the influenza virus, which has a very specific course and can be determined based on symptoms already in the first days of illness. "In this case, tests are also taken to provide laboratory confirmation of the presence of the influenza virus," says the family doctor. This is important both for determining treatment and for preventing or limiting outbreaks, for example, in a workplace, gym, or school.
"HALF-MOON": What books to read in the autumnal corona crisis Does the time spent at home bring about an increase in reading?! It's hard to say, quantity may not be that important in the end. What can we find in bookstores? Of course, biographies and cookbooks top the charts, but luckily there is more. Journalist Andres Raid and legal scholar and clergyman Igor Gräzin talk about books around us and within reach.
Upside-down green turn or simply stupidity cubed: toilets and trash cans disappear from the side of state roads. Another example of saving on the wrong side comes from the Transport Department, which goes against the widely implemented green thinking here. Since the Transport Department needs to cut operating costs by over 3.5 million euros next year, removing toilets and trash cans from parking lots was found as one of the cost-saving measures. The decision was made based on the fact that traffic safety suffers the least when cutting these costs, explained Raido Randmaa, the director of the Transport Department's infrastructure management service, to ERR. The Transport Department owns 61 toilets in parking lots across Estonia and 63 trash containers in parking lots. Toilets cost the department 472,000 euros per year, and trash cans cost 267,000 euros. According to Randmaa, the decision has already been made in the Transport Department, but since the department's budget has not been finally approved yet, the decision does not have a signature. "Oh my heavens - as the former CEO of Circle K and now as the CEO of Ragn-Sells, I can't stay silent," comments top executive Kai Realo on social media about this decision. "When Circle K wanted to build service stations along the new highways, where, as we know, there are both trash cans and toilets, the biggest challenge was to find locations where the former Road Administration would have given proper entrances and exits because 'Estonia is so small that a person can drive from one end of the country to the other in one go and they don't need to refuel, eat, or use the toilet along the way'." Realo adds that such an attitude left her speechless at the time, but the current decision is downright outrageous: "Can you imagine this 'land of peeing men' and those piles of trash on the edge of the forest?"
Estonian "openness" is also exploited by Latin American prostitutes and illegal immigrants. "Openness" has made Estonia a magnet for representatives of the shadow side. BNS writes: On Wednesday, the police deported a woman from Brazil who had worked as a prostitute in the capital. According to the North Prefecture of the Police and Border Guard Board, the visa-free stay of a 29-year-old Brazilian citizen in Estonia was prematurely terminated on Wednesday, November 24, as she provided sexual services in Tallinn for money. The woman was issued an order to leave Estonia and a one-year entry ban to the Schengen territory was imposed on her. This is not the first time. In July of this year, the police deported a woman with Colombian citizenship who worked as a prostitute in Estonia. At that time, the North Prefecture conducted an illegal procedure against a woman born in 1988 and a citizen of Colombia who arrived in Estonia with the intention of providing intimate services. The woman was issued an order to leave the country and a three-year entry ban was imposed on her. In December 2019, the portal Uued Uudised wrote: "The police deported a man from Brazil who worked as a prostitute in Tallinn. On Thursday, an employee of the North Border Guard and Migration Inspectorate conducted an illegal procedure against a Brazilian citizen born in 1998, according to the North Prefecture. The man did not want to cooperate with the police officers and had also provided sexual services for money in Tallinn. The man's travel purpose did not correspond to the actual purpose. The police terminated the man's visa-free stay prematurely, issued an order for him to leave Estonia, and imposed a three-year entry ban on him." Latin Americans have also been found in Estonia through other routes. In August of this year, Delfi Ärileht wrote: "On the evening of August 4, a car with Estonian registration plates, a Toyota Yaris, driven by a Brazilian citizen born in 1993, was checked in Tallinn. The woman turned out to be an unauthorized food courier who will be deported from Estonia. The vehicle had a food bag from the courier company, and from the woman's phone it was visible that she had fulfilled the last order less than 10 minutes ago. Her short-term employment was not registered with the Police and Border Guard Board. Her visa was declared invalid and her visa-free stay in Estonia was shortened once. The woman was issued an order to leave Estonia within 15 days and a three-month entry ban was imposed on her."
Twenty-seven migrants who drowned in the English Channel were immediately thrown into the propaganda mill. The death of twenty-seven migrants in the autumnal waters of the English Channel is undoubtedly a great tragedy, but the liberal West immediately threw it into their propaganda, largely to justify their inaction. The most hypocritical move was made by France, whose President Emmanuel Macron warned British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday against exploiting the migration crisis for political purposes, referring to the boat accident in the English Channel that claimed the lives of 27 people. Before that, however, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed in a phone conversation on Wednesday to intensify action against deadly sea crossings. "Both leaders were clear that today's tragic loss of life served as a stark reminder of the importance of keeping all options on the table to stop these lethal sea crossings and break the business model of the criminal gangs behind them," said a spokesperson for the British government. The United Kingdom is the country where these people aspire to go, and France is a transit country where they all pass through unhindered and live in tent camps waiting for human traffickers - Paris should have all the means to prevent migrants from using it as a springboard into the country, not to mention blocking the English Channel for human trafficking. The British don't want them, neither do the French - so what are the obstacles to closing the migration route? Following the drowning of at least 27 migrants in the English Channel on Wednesday, five people have been arrested, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin announced on Thursday. According to the prosecutor in Lille, the boat that sank near the northern coast of France on Wednesday claimed the lives of 17 men, seven women, and three minors. Four suspects in human smuggling were already arrested on Wednesday afternoon, Darmanin clarified. French authorities did not hold back their words to express their alleged dismay, while human traffickers could not operate without state support - and this support comes from both maintaining the Manche migration route (which could be closed) and creating a favorable environment for human trafficking through mass migration as a national policy. President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday evening that France will not allow the English Channel to become a "graveyard" and promised that the authorities will find those responsible for this tragedy. French prosecutors have launched a murder investigation. The president does not consider himself guilty, although it is during his rule that France has been flooded with migrants. French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin called for a "strong international response". He said that four people suspected of direct involvement in the incident have been arrested. "The criminal nature of the smugglers organizing these crossings cannot be condemned enough," he added. "This catastrophe in the Channel is a tragedy," tweeted Prime Minister Jean Castex. "My thoughts are with the missing and the victims who fell prey to these criminals who exploit their distress and misery." The hypocritical talk of French authorities about human trafficking and drowning deaths will not prevent them.
Among the most frequently rolled back mileage cars, German elite brands are leading the way. Rolling back the mileage is one of the most common scams in the used car market. This increases the price of dishonestly manipulated used vehicles and damages the value of the car. According to a recent carVertical study, buyers of German elite brands are at the highest risk of purchasing a car with altered odometer readings. The TOP 10 models with the most frequently rolled back mileage include BMW M5 in the first place. To determine the list of cars with the most frequently rolled back mileage, IT company carVertical analyzed the history of over 700,000 used cars from reports created between November 2020 and November 2021. 18 different markets were examined, including Poland, Romania, Hungary, France, Slovenia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Serbia, Germany, Croatia, Russia, United States, and Italy. The mileage data shows that BMW M5 is the car with the most altered odometer readings; over a third of used vehicles were associated with possible fraud. This separate statistical indicator does not reflect the extent of the odometer rollback problem with BMWs - as CarVertical's automotive expert Matas Buzelis recently noted, the entire list is dominated by various BMW models: "Half of the TOP 10 list is occupied by cars from this manufacturer. The indicator correlates with the demand for used BMWs in different markets. The data also reveals that more expensive cars are more likely to have altered mileage, and this fact should be taken into account when searching for a used vehicle. This is where checking the mileage of the car comes in handy." In the ranking of cars with rolled back mileage, BMW 7 Series and Subaru Outback are in second and third place respectively, with 33.4% and 31.8%. Audi A8 was the fifth most frequent car with mileage fraud, as its sportier sibling A7 achieved the tenth place, with just over a quarter (25.8%) of such vehicles having artificially reduced mileage according to the study. Matas Buzelis explains that the higher representation of higher-class vehicles in the list of cars with altered odometer readings is primarily due to the greater potential profit margin in the sale of such used cars. Odometer rollback is a relatively cheap and simple method that provides dishonest car dealers with an opportunity for additional earnings. For a longer list of the 20 most frequently rolled back mileage cars, refer to the entire study. Models with the most frequently rolled back mileage by year of production: the risk of fraud is higher with older cars. Studies show that it is important to check the mileage of a used car, especially for older vehicles. The most popular models with altered odometer readings were produced between 2006 and 2016. However, automotive expert Matas Buzelis emphasizes that there is a connection between the possibility of fraud and the price range of the car: "The list of cars with the most frequently rolled back mileage consists mainly of elite-class vehicles, but there are also models of popular cars, although their share is smaller compared to the total number of cars with altered mileage. Subaru, Ford, and Volkswagen cars belong to the same age group as higher-class vehicles. It seems that cars between 5 and 15 years old are most likely to have their mileage rolled back.
Chamber of Agriculture: Production cannot be sacrificed for the green transition The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce believes that in order to achieve climate neutrality, efforts must be made by entrepreneurs, consumers, and the state. However, achieving green transition goals cannot be done by reducing local production and the number of animals. The changes associated with the green transition must also be economically feasible for businesses, which requires effort from entrepreneurs, consumers, and the state together. The Chamber of Agriculture emphasizes the importance of understanding the impact of the climate package and the EU Green Deal strategies on Estonian agriculture and food production before making decisions. To get an overview of the real environmental impact of the Estonian agricultural sector, a comprehensive assessment based on location and management method is needed. Similarly, achieving green transition goals cannot be done by reducing local production and the number of animals. The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce supports the direction taken by the European Commission to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, although it will be a major challenge for our agriculture, food industry, forestry, and rural sector. However, every challenge also brings opportunities that need to be skillfully utilized, as stated in the opinion sent by the Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce to the Ministry of the Environment regarding the European Commission's climate package "Fit for 55", as reported by BNS. The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce, which last year led the initiative to import Ukrainians under the leadership of its CEO Roomet Sõrmus, is trying to make an impression both on the green transition and on farmers. However, the desires of farmers and climate alarmists are so different that it is difficult to reconcile them. In addition, farmers are haunted by various ideological associations and pressure groups, such as animal and environmental activists, vegans, and others, whose activities are aimed at restricting and ending animal husbandry.
Migration pressure is increasing: Finnish entrepreneurs in Estonia are also complaining and threatened with tax increases. It is sad and funny that the mouthpiece for the Reform Party's immigration plans is the Finns, who complain that there is a shortage of labor in Estonia, while Estonians work in neighboring Finland - they should bring Estonians back home to Finnish companies here. However, the media is trumpeting about labor shortages every day, which is probably a new propaganda campaign to get people used to immigration. This is what BNS writes: At a meeting of the Finnish-Estonian Chamber of Commerce held on Tuesday, foreign entrepreneurs operating in Estonia saw a labor shortage as the biggest problem in the Estonian business environment. "Estonian and Finnish companies have a common problem, where in a country with an aging population, there is an increasing shortage of skilled labor," said Minister of Entrepreneurship and Information Technology Andres Sutt through a press release. "At the same time, we see recruiting skilled workers from abroad who share our common values and ensuring tax compliance as the only short-term solution to solve the growing skilled labor crisis on both sides of the shore," he added. Andres Sutt should look more closely towards Finland - they solve labor problems with the help of Somali and other "skilled workers" from Mooram countries - and say whether the Reform Party also sees a way out in them. The minister does not want to address the issue that behind the statement "Estonian and Finnish companies have a common problem" are also Estonians who emigrated during the previous government of the Reform Party. This story is illustrated by a threat: "According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (MKM), in five years there will be approximately 31,000 fewer working-age people in Estonia, and an alternative to increasing the state's revenue base would be raising taxes." In other words, it is being threatened that if foreigners are not accepted, taxes will rise and pensions will not be received. However, it is "forgotten" that foreign workers lower the wages of Estonian people. Meanwhile, such threats had subsided, but just a few years ago it was written about how tens of thousands of workers would be missing in construction, agriculture, and elsewhere in 2040 - as if there would be no technological development in 20 years and everyone would still be doing manual labor in the aforementioned year.
Paul Oja: gloomy visions of the future in Tom Clancy's action novels also spoke of a pandemic In the 1960s, Soviet science fiction gradually began to break free from the narrow focus on technical details or the fight against villains. On one hand, bright visions of a happy communist future for humanity were constructed (Ivan Yefremov's "Andromeda Nebula" in 1957, Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's "Noon" in 1962), on the other hand, Western fantasy or dystopias created in the conditions of decaying capitalism were condemned, depicting future wars, acts of terrorism, or pandemics. Most often, it was exclaimed: "In the year 2000...!" But as we know, Soviet communism disappeared along with its bright visions of the future, long before that magical year. Keen-eyed Western writers, however, continue to provide food for thought with their works. Tom Clancy, a skillful and prolific writer of techno-thrillers or technical action literature, kept a close eye on world events. In 1975, a Soviet missile carrier attempted to escape from the port of Riga to Sweden, but was forced to stop 50 miles before Swedish territorial waters. In 1984, Clancy's thriller "The Hunt for Red October" was published, which could have been inspired by this event, and it became a global bestseller. "Patriot Games" (1987) tells the story of the Irish Republican Army's terrorist activities. "The Cardinal of the Kremlin" (1988) sheds light on the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union in space against the backdrop of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, with a subplot about the Soviet Union's hopelessly deadlocked war in Afghanistan. "Clear and Present Danger" (1989) describes the war against drug lords in the Colombian forests and Washington's cabinets, while "The Sum of All Fears" (1991) explores what would happen if Middle Eastern terrorists gained control of a nuclear weapon. Gradually, however, the temporal relationship between Tom Clancy and the material he dealt with began to change. Careful monitoring of global trends made it possible to predict certain key events - unfortunately, in the form of dark scenarios that sadly had a tendency to become reality. In the novel "Debt of Honor" (1994), a terrorist crashes a large passenger plane into the White House just as Congress is in session with the President present. The novel was published in 1994; we know all too well what happened on September 9, 2001. Not all of Clancy's ominous visions have come true. The major war between China and Russia described in the novel "The Bear and the Dragon" (2000) has not occurred. What else? Contrary to Francis Fukuyama's opinion and the proclamation of the end of history during the perestroika era, history is far from over... In the novel "Executive Orders" (1996), the United States is attacked with a bacterial weapon in an attempt to bring about the collapse of the country through an epidemic. Thanks to widespread vaccination, the epidemic quickly subsides. It is much easier to come up with a truly effective vaccine in a novel than in reality. In the novel "Rainbow Six" (1998), the threat is much more serious. A top scientist, who is also the head of one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, has gathered around him a group of eco-terrorists who have decided to eliminate a large part of the world's population during a pandemic in order to save the planet from the catastrophic consequences of human activity. A deadly virus is developed based on Ebola. At the same time, two vaccines are created. Vaccine A provides genuine protection against the disease. It is administered to like-minded individuals and other trustworthy or necessary people before the virus is released. Vaccine B, however, is intended to be widely distributed shortly after the pandemic breaks out. It seems to provide protection, but it is actually designed to further spread the disease in order to achieve the original goals. The plan is to spread the virus through the air humidification system at the stadium of the Olympic Games held in hot weather in Australia. Brave members of the counter-terrorism group Rainbow, with the help of a former KGB officer, manage to apprehend them at the last moment, saving humanity from the evil plague, and life goes on as before.

A step towards sustainability: SEAT connects its factories in Spain and Portugal by rail to reduce CO2 emissions. Spanish car manufacturer SEAT has set a goal to become a carbon-neutral company by 2050. To achieve this, SEAT has launched the environmental program "Move to Zerø" to reduce CO2 emissions throughout the life cycle of products, services, and mobility solutions. Now, SEAT plans to take another step forward in the "Move to Zerø" strategy by establishing a new rail service that connects its Martorell (Spain) factory with the Volkswagen Autoeuropa factory in Palmela (Portugal). Previously, vehicles produced in Martorell were transported by train to Salobral (Madrid) and then delivered by truck to various dealerships. With the new line, the vehicles will go directly to the Palmela factory, from where they will be transported by truck for the last time to the Azambuja distribution depot, located 75 kilometers away. Currently, the service will operate twice a week and is expected to transport over 20,000 vehicles per year. This will avoid 2,400 truck journeys per year and reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 43%. The new train service, operated by Pecovasa Renfe Mercancías, consists of 16 wagons. Its maximum length is 500 meters and it can carry up to 184 vehicles per trip. From 2023, an 18-wagon train will be introduced, capable of transporting nearly 200 vehicles at once. By 2024, hybrid locomotives will start running on the tracks, allowing for the use of 100% electricity on the route.
Green light from the European Medicines Agency: Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine is suitable for children aged 5-11. On Thursday, the European Medicines Agency recommended expanding the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, to children aged 5-11. Previously, the vaccine was authorized for those aged 12 and older. The dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5-11 is three times smaller than the regular dose (10 µg compared to 30 µg). Just like in older age groups, the vaccine course for children consists of two doses administered three weeks apart. A clinical study conducted with 2000 children showed that 5-11-year-olds had similar immune responses with the three times smaller dose compared to older age groups receiving the full dose. The side effects were similar to those in older age groups and were mild or moderate, resolving within a few days. Therefore, the European Medicines Agency concluded that the benefits of the vaccine for children aged 5-11 outweigh the associated risks. The agency will now send its recommendation to the European Commission, which will make the final decision regarding the use of the vaccine. Marje Oona, a member of the National Immunoprophylaxis Expert Committee, told ERR that the committee will likely make a decision on this matter next week. "Since the approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is in place, we know that the approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been in place for some time. The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices gave this recommendation quite a while ago, and over three million children have already been vaccinated in the United States, so I don't really see a strong reason why it wouldn't be given. But we haven't discussed it yet," commented Dr. Oona.
