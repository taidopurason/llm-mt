A traffic flow is a study that looks at the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and interactions between them.
Unfortunately, exploring traffic flows is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100 % certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, so the traffic flows tend to be somewhat reasonably consistent and can be broadly mathematically presented.
To better describe the flow of traffic, connections between three main characteristics have been created: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These connections contribute to the design, design and operation of the driveway facilities.

In the savannah, a primable that has a human digestive system is difficult to meet the needs of their amino acids with the help of the plants available.
Moreover, if it cannot be done, it has serious consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition and finally death.
The most easily available vegetable sources would have been proteins in leaf and vegetables, but for our primates, they are easy to digest only.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all the necessary amino acids.
With all this in mind, we should not be surprised that our own predecessors solved their protein problem in about the same way as chimpanzees today in Savanna.

The word civilization comes from the Latin word in Civil, which means a "civic" related to Latin for civis, "citizen", and civitas, which means "city or city country", and to some extent defines the size of society.
City states are the forerunners of the countries.Civilization culture means conveying knowledge over several generations, a permanent cultural footprint and sufficient cultural broadcast.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving appropriate historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh island in the world!
Because of the Japanese island bunch/group, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
Taiwan was mentioned in the 15th century, when European sailors sailed the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East Indian Company founded a base in Taiwan, southwest of the East Indian Company, initiating the transformation of indigenous cereal production practices and hiring Chinese workers in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took the coastal areas of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan as the Qing Empire province in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the first China-Japan (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty Government signed the Shimonosec Peace Treaty, which transferred Taiwan to the right of governance to Japan, which prevailed until 1945.
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze it into a pure wet hand ball.
The moisture of your hands reacts with the external layers, which creates a funny feeling and forms as if to last.
This is called the chemical pH.You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes the color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) this chemical is.
The pH level shows the amount of hydrogen ions in the chemical studied (H is the hydrogen in the pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups, or praids.
The herds consist of one to three adult male and up to thirty female and puppies.
Females are usually very closely linked, forming a family of large sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave in many ways like wolf and dog herds- animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very fatal to their prey animals.
The lower level of these are medium -sized cats with medium -sized prey, from rabbits to antelops and goats.
The latter is a lot of small cats (including stray home cats) who eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specific work that every cat does, which keeps him from competing with others.
Lots like to eat small animals.They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds where possible.Almost all of the animals that are hunting for directly are significantly smaller than him.
According to scientists, direct loots are pursued and found by the smell of prey (victims), sniffing the places they have been.
Their ability to see in the dark is great, and they are moving very well.Directly blends into the surrounding environment for hunting prey and then jumps on the catch.
The tiger, a versatile athlete, is able to climb (though not well), swim, overpower, overpowering and pulling five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and Jaaguars.Only these four cats can roar.
The tiger roar is not like a lion loud roar, but rather a sentence of the words screaming.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
The plants prepare the sun with photosynthesis.They also shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants.Most of the foods we eat are of plants.Without plants, animals would not survive.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is released from the main population from which they come from (for example, they move across a mountain range or a river or move to a new island, and return is not easy), they often get into a different environment.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different features of the past and must adapt to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
As time goes by, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they look less and less like another population.
In the end, in thousands of or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process a species blank, which simply means the development of a new species.A species of species is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Insects were the first animals to move with the air.Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies much easier and find food and companion much more efficiently.
Most insects are able to fold their wings against the body.
This gives them more opportunities to find small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects who are unable to turn their wings backwards, wedges and one -day butterflies.
Many of today's paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day.We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But the birds still have several features that look like a dinosaur.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like T-REE.
Mosaur was a top caretaker of his time and was therefore not afraid of anything other than other mosaurus.
His long jaws had over 70 extremely sharp teeth, plus additional teeth in the palate, which means that nothing that his paths crossed could escape.
It is certainly not known, but the mosaurus may have had a bifurcated language.Its dining table included turtles, large fish, other mosaurons, and may have even been a human eater.
He also attacked everyone who went into the water, even a huge dinosaur, as if T-Rex was not an opponent for him.
The Italian national football team is the most successful team in the world alongside the German national football team and won the 2006 FIFA World Championship.

The Vatican population is about 800 people.It is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also a daily language used by most people in the country, while Latin is used at religious services.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, there was a vesic cluster in almost every house connected to a complex sewerage system.
The remains of sewer systems have been found in Crete, Minos culture cities, and in Santorin, Greece.
The toilets were also available in ancient Egypt, Persia and China.In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public hot houses with men and women confused.
The nuclear bomb works according to the principle that it takes energy to assemble the cell nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Just like pushing up a hill.Returning the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have an unstable core, which means that they tend to decompose on a small nap or spontaneously.
Thus, when it was first introduced, a pencil was a good friend for many.
The importance and use of the pencil have been reduced, as unfortunately newer writing methods have been created.
People now write messages to computer screens without ever having to use a sharpener.
You can only speculate on what will happen from the keyboard when something new arises.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you will use satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost immediately.
The satellite was sent to a space rocket.Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a little light and view.
A giant rocket that is above 100 feet in height is required to send satellite or telescope to space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way.The most important change that the wheel has brought to us is much easier and faster transport.
As a result, we have a train, a car and many other transport equipment.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust.The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The bark is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It is thinner under the heat and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the closer side because the crust is thinner.It was easier to get to the surface on the lava.
Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite - the solar system with the sun (and even other letters) moved around the earth.
This seems reasonable because you don't feel the land is moving, isn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world.It flows as much water eight times as in the world's largest river.
Amazon is also the broadest river on the globe, sometimes six miles wide.
20% of the water flowing from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from Amazon.
The Amazon Peak River is 6387 km (3980 miles).Water reaches thousands of smaller rivers.
Gold can be processed into any form.It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted or braided.It can be back or rolled into thin leaves.
It can be made very thin and placed on other metals.This can be done so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand -painted pictures of books, called illuminated manuscripts.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
You may also have alloys containing small amounts of non -metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe consists of matter.The whole matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that they fit into the point of the point at the end of this sentence.
People have felt the basic elements of chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, since antiquity, as they can naturally be found in nature and are relatively easy to minimize with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle assumed that everything was made up of one or more of the four elements mixtures.They were land, water, air and fire.
It was more like four aggregates (in the same order) - solid, liquid, gaseous and plasing - although it also speculated that they form new substances we see.
During the American War of Independence, thirteen colonies formed a weak central government first under the Statute of the Confederation, the only part of which was the Congress.
The congress did not have the power to establish taxes, and because of the lack of state enforcement or judicial power, it was based on the establishment of all legislation on the states, which were often not very cooperative.
He also did not have the authority to cancel tax laws and inter -state tariffs.
The articles demanded unanimous consent from all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
If you've seen the movie "National Trade", you may think that a treasure card was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true.Although something has been written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words" "Original Declaration of Independence, Date 4 July 1776" "were written. The text is reversed at the bottom of the document."
Although no one knows who wrote it, it is known that in its early years of life, a large parchment document (its dimensions 29 ¾ times 24 ½ inches) had been rolled.
This is likely that the note was simply added as a bridge.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings - namely intihuatana, sunshade and three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex are rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they initially looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
Although the construction of the pyramids continued until the end of the old kingdom, nothing exceeded the size of the Giza pyramids or their technical knowledge.
The old Egyptians of the new country admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
D-day and subsequent battles released the northern part of France, but the south was still not free.
Vichy French ruled there.These were the people of France, who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, this action was called dragon.
In only two weeks, Americans and liberated French troops had released southern France and turned to Germany.
Adam Cuerden, the Commons project manager, expressed his dissatisfaction with the deletion when he spoke last month with Wikinews.

Due to the upset community, a new policy was designed to deal with sexual content for millions of open -license platforms for a hosting site.
Anyone who is driving at high latitudes or over the gorge should take into account the possibility that snow, ice or low temperatures may occur.
The icy and snowy roads have a small friction force and you cannot drive the same way as you are on the bare asphalt.
During the snow storm, enough snow may be rainy in a short period of time to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or flying snow or condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions in many countries are commonplace and traffic continues mostly throughout the year.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchy and formal than what the Westerners may be used to.
Suits are a normal workwear and co -workers call each other by surnames or job titles.
