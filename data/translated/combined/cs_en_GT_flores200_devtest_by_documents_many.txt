Everyone participates in life in society and uses traffic systems.Almost everyone complains about traffic systems.
In developed countries you rarely encounter a similar degree of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transport systems evoke so many complaints, why do they fail every day?Are traffic engineers just unfit?Or is it something deeper?
Operation is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, exploring the flow of operation is difficult, because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with 100 % certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly in a certain range;Therefore, traffic usually has a reasonable consistency and can be approximately mathematically depicted.
In order to better represent the flow of the operation, relations between three main characteristics were determined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate transport facilities.

Hershey -Chase experiment was one of the main evidence that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant your own bottom into bacteria.
They performed two experiments in which they either labeled DNA in a phage with radioactive phosphorus or protein in a pipe with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the meaning of the influenced piece of genetic material and whether the cells of the germ line have been affected.
Only mutations in the germ line of cells can be transmitted to children, while other mutations may cause cell or cancer.

Danielle Lantagne, a UN expert on this disease, said the epidemic was probably caused by peace units.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method.This method is in fact a guide to most scientific research.
But it is not in itself experimenting.The experiment is a test that is used to denial one or more possible hypotheses, but asking questions and observation is also important for scientific research.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside the area of secular life.He often visited the cave known as "hira" on a mountain called "noor" and there contour there.
The cave itself, which has survived a considerable time, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual focus.

The horse -drawn pathways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the stagecoach paths mostly consisted only of parallel boards, they allowed towing horses to achieve higher speeds and bring a heavier burden than on the other paths of the time, which were slightly coarser.
The sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place.Gradually, however, it has been found that the tracks are more efficient if the iron belt has a belt on their surface.
This has become a common phenomenon, but iron caused more wear of wooden wheels.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron.In 1767 the first lift rails were introduced.
Romanticism carried a significant element of cultural determinism drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geographically formed individuals, and over time, there were customs and culture related to this geography and these, because they were in line with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Technological determinism is a term that includes a wide range of ideas in practice: for example, so -called PUSCH technology or technological imperative, or belief that human destiny is controlled by all -pervading logic together with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology is followed by a way that greatly exceeds cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has an "influence" on societies that are inherent than socially conditional society.
For example, we can say that when motor cars appear, it will necessarily lead to road development.
But the nationwide road network is not economically viable for mere a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in cases of road accidents, causing inventing new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.

The calipers that hang on both sides of the saddle serve as a support for the rider's legs.
The riders provide greater stability, but they can be associated with security problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet are stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown out of the horse, but his leg is caught in the caliper and the horse begins to run, the rider can pull behind him.A number of security measures can be taken to minimize this risk.
First, most riders wear riding shoes with heel and fine sole, which is quite narrow.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English, safety skiing, allow the yoke belt to fall from the saddle when the falling rider pulls behind him.

For primates with a human -like digestive system, it is difficult to satisfy the need for amino acids from plant sources available in an open savannah.
In addition, if they do not, it has serious consequences: growth of depression, malnutrition and eventually death.
Proteins would be available in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for our primates if they are not cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a high amount of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved the protein problem just as chimpanzees in the savannah today do.
Subcultures combine similarly -minded individuals who feel neglected by social standards and allow them to develop an identity.
Subcultures may be different in terms of age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or gender of members.
The properties that distinguish the subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often show their membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of a style that includes dressing, behavior and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw from several unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized for socializing due to neglect, unfortunate or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "wolf" children.Some wolf children have been imprisoned for a long time (they were usually imprisoned by their own parents), in some cases they lived abandoned because their parents refused them because of their severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children could experience serious abuse or trauma, whereupon they were abandoned or escaped.
Others are said to have been brought up by animals, while some are claimed to have lived in the wild themselves.
In complete education of inhuman animals, a wild child shows almost identical behavior (within physical possibilities) as a given caring animal, such as its fear or ignorance towards humans.
Self -multi -agriculture is agriculture performed for production of only a lot of food that will meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.

Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of perfection as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often act as contact points of their own physical group.
They often have greater independence than ordinary team members, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
The unique component of the virtual team is also the presence of the so -called "invisible team" (Larson - Lafasto, 1989, p. 109).
The "Invisible Team" is a team of management that every member is subordinate.The invisible team sets standards for individual members.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior may occur when managers begin to lead their former colleagues - peers.At one end of the spectrum is an effort to stay "one of them" (or one of them).
This type of manager has difficulty taking unpopular decisions, introducing disciplinary measures, performance evaluation, allocating responsibility and leading people to responsibility.
At the other end of the spectrum, one changes beyond recognition and feels that he has to change everything the team does and do it by himself.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in disagreement between the leaders and the rest of the team.

In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the backyard;The shops were only open shelves facing the street.A stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the country of Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland was inhabited sparsely.In the Nordic sagas, it is written that Erik Rudý was expelled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled to the west, he found Greenland and named him a green country.
Despite his finding, the tribes of the Eskimos lived there.
Although all countries were part of "Scandinavia", among the inhabitants, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland there were many differences.
While most of their meals would not be alien to us, the Romans had their share of special or unusual feast compositions, including a wild boar, a peacock, a snail and a kind of rodent called a dorm.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their food sitting on chairs, while wealthy men liked to organize banquets together and lying on their side while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not include food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had never tasted a turkey.
Civilization is a certain culture, a common large group of people who live and work in mutual cooperation, ie together they form society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means "civil" and it is related to the Latin "civis", which means "citizen" and "civitas", which means a city or city state, and at the same time defines in some way the size of society.
The predecessors of the nations were city states.The culture of civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge for several generations, the presence of long -lasting cultural tracks and adequate spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands and the largest of them is Honšu, so Japan is actually the 7th largest island in the world!
With regard to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is sometimes called "archipelago" in the geographical sense.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when near the European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East Indian company creates a base in the southwestern Taiwan and initiates the transformation of the original practice of grain production, employs Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 the units of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) took over the southwestern and north coasts of Taiwan and in 1885 Taiwan was declared the province of the Empire Qing.
In 1895, after a defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing Government signed the Simonosek Mírov Treaty, on the basis of which it handed over the sovereignty over Taiwan Japan.This ruled this island until 1945.
Mix both dry powders together and then create a ball with clean hands.
Moisture on your hands will respond with the outer layers, which will result in a special feeling and forms a kind of shell.
This is called the pH of the chemical.You can create an indicator yourself using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color as the chemical is acidic or alkaline (alkaline).
The pH value is determined according to the amount of hydrogen ions (letter H in the ph) in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been taken (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Lions are the most special cats, they live in large groups called packs.
The pack consists of one to three relatives of adult males along with up to thirty females and chicks.
Females are usually closely related and represent a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
The lion pack behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to the lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
Below them are medium -sized felines, whose food consists of medium -sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In the end, there are a lot of small cats (including wild domestic cats), whose main proportion of diet is small prey like insects, rodents, reptiles and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the system of ecological Nik, ie.that every cat has its own tasks that do not allow it to compete with others.
The steel likes to eat small animals.If they have the option, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds.Almost all the animals that hunt steel are much smaller than himself.
Scientists believe that the steel is monitored and found animals to eat (prey) according to the smell, when they sniff, where they moved on the ground.
At night they see very well thanks to night vision and can move very quietly.The steels hunt by merge with their surroundings and then jump on their prey.
The tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump over long distances and pull with five times more power than a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Genus panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguaries.These four cats are the only ones they can yell.
The tiger roar is not like the roar of a lion from a full throat, but rather as a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe and receive carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants make their nutrition from the Sun through photosynthesis.They also provide shadow.
We produce our houses and clothes from plants.Most of the foods we eat are of plant origin.Without plants, animals could not survive.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they come from (for example, when a mountain ridge or a river passes or move to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), they often find themselves in a different environment than inwhat they were before.
This new environment has different sources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or ways of adaptation to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they begin to look less and less than other populations.
In the end, for several thousand or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called specialization, which means the emergence of new species.Specialization is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Insects were the first animals to take off into the air.Their ability to fly allowed them to avoid enemies and find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage that their wings can fold back along the body.
This provides them with a larger selection of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Nowadays, they are the only insects that cannot fold wings, dragonflies and needles.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day.We call them birds.
Many people do not think about them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still a lot of characters that resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, tolerate eggs and walk on their two back legs like T-Rex.
Mosasaurus was the top of the predator of his time, so he wasn't worried about any other Mosasaur.
His long jaws were covered with more than 70 teeth as sharp as a razor and an extra set set on the upper floor, which means that nothing that would cross his way had a chance to escape.
We do not know for sure, but they could have a jagged tongue.Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe they could be cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water.Even a big dinosaur, such as T. Rex, was no opponent for them.

Harappa and Mohenjodaro had a flush toilet in almost every house connected to a sophisticated waste system.
The remains of waste water drainage systems were found in minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China.In Old Rome, the toilets were sometimes part of the public spa, which were attended by men and women together.
The fission nuclear bomb works on the principle that the kernel with many protons and neutrons together is needed.
It's something like driving a heavy trolley uphill.By re -establishing the atomic core, part of this energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they tend to disintegrate in fine or even no contact.
Therefore, after its invention, the pencil has become a good friend of many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been moved to lower position and by -use with the occurrence of new ways of writing.
Today, people write messages on computer screens, so they don't get into contact with the sharpener at all.
One can only marvel at what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes.
If you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use satellite to call.
The satellite in space receives a call and then reflects its signal almost immediately back down.
The satellite was brought into space by a rocket.Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts the light and field of view.
A large missile is required to bring a satellite or telescope into space, which measures over 100 feet.
The bike changed the world in an unprecedented way.The most important thing that caused was a substantial facilitation and acceleration of transport.
It brought us a train, a car and other means of transport.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust.The outer layer of the moon is called a crust.
The bark is approximately 70 km thick on the forthcoming side and about 100 km on the other side.
Below the sea is weaker and under the mountains again stronger.
On the closer side there can be more lunar seas, because the bark is thinner here.Lava could thus get to the surface more easily.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite;that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars) moves around the ground.
That sounds sensible, because one doesn't come, that the earth is moving, isn't it?
Amazon is the largest and the second longest river on the ground.It flows more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the ground, in some places it is up to six miles wide.
The whole 20 percent of the water flowing from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main flow of the Amazon is 6 387 km (3,980 miles).It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes.It can be rolled into miniature pieces.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be bent and weaved.Can be pushed or pressed into slices.
It can be processed into considerable thinness and attached to another metal.It can be made so thin that it was often used to decorate hand -painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals.Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are among the metals.Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include a small number of non -metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter.All mass consists of small particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that in the end of this sentence, trillions would fit.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, as these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be relatively easy to mine using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements.These elements were ground, water, air and fire.
It was more like four states of mass (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also theorized that it was turning into new substances that shape what we see.
During the war for the independence of the thirteen states, first formed a weak central government, when Congress was its only component falling under the articles of the Confederation.
The Congress came to the imposition of taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial body, he relied on state authorities that often did not cooperate.
Also, there was no authority to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all states before they could be supplemented.The states took the central government lightly, so much that their representatives were often not present.
If you have seen treasure hunters, you may think that a map for treasure has been drawn on the back of the Independence Declaration.
But this is not true.Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Independence Declaration there are words "The original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776".The text is on the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known with certainty, it is clear that a large parchment document (dimensions of 29¾ x 24½ inches) was not long after its creation into the role and stored.
It is therefore likely that the entry was simply added as a stick.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main heels: intihuatan, temple of the sun and room of three windows.
Most buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to have tourists have a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like ..
By 1976, 30 % of Machu Picchu was restored and the restoration continues to this day.
Although building stone pyramids continued until the end of the old empire, the pyramids in Giza have never been overcome in size or in the technical precision of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire marvel at the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at that time.
The landing in Normandy and the subsequent battles brought the liberation of northern France, but the south of the country has not yet been liberated.
He was ruled by the French "Vichy".These were the French who closed peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invasion forces instead of fighting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies made an invasion of southern France.The invasion was called the Dragoon operation.
In just two weeks, Americans and free French forces liberated southern France and turned to Germany.

The indignation of the community has led to the current efforts to prepare the rules concerning sexual content for a website that contains millions of media with an open license.
Anyone who controls high geographical height or mountain pass was supposed to consider snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On ice and snowy roads, friction is low and therefore you cannot drive as well as on the bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow attacks in a very short time to make it impossible to ride.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or flying snow or plowing or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
LED and snow, on the other hand, are normal in many countries and the traffic continues without major interruptions throughout the year.
