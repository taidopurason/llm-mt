Dr.Tony Moll has discovered tuberculosis, which is resistant to many medicines (XDR-TB) in the South African province of Kwazulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new version "arouses considerable care and discomfort due to the exceptional degree of mortality."
Some patients were able to stove the bacterium in the hospital, says Dr.Moll, and at least two were health care workers at the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
The proportion of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis always seems low;6000 out of a total of 330,000 infected at any time in South Africa.
Nextgen is a system that FAA claims to allow aircraft to fly on shorter lines, saving millions of gallon fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite -based technology rather than old technology based on stationary radars, allowing the flight controller to more accurately determine the location of the aircraft and provide pilots more accurate information.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pun (FKP), and its value is determined equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
Cash can be replaced at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted by virtually all islands, and at Stanley, they mostly receive credit cards and US dollars.
They are unlikely to receive credit cards on the outside of the lying islands, but they may accept British and US currency;For owners, know in advance which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to replace the Falkland currency outside the islands, so replace the cash before leaving the islands.

There are many social and political effects, such as the use of a metric system, the transition from absolutism to Republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, the professions were open to all male seekers, allowing them to succeed the most ambitious and successful.
This also applies to the army, as military ranks are now based on caliber instead of on the class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed members of the working class from other countries to start their revolutions.
In society, everyone is involved and used transport systems.Almost all of them complain about transport systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge demolition.
Why are there so many complaints at the expense of transport systems, why do they fail every day?Is it to blame for traffic engineers?Or maybe it's something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is to study the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult, as the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100 % certainty.
Thankfully, the behavior of drivers is generally established to some extent, so traffic flows are also established and can be roughly presented in mathematical form.
In order to better illustrate the flow of traffic, the relationships between the main three characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help to design, design and operate roads.
The funeral in Rome was attended by more than four million people.
There were so many people present that it was by no means possible to provide access to a funeral at St.Peter.
In order for people to be able to watch the ceremony, several large television screens have been erected in different places around Rome.
Similar layouts, which have been viewed by many people, have also been taken care of in many other Italian cities and elsewhere in the world, especially in Poland.
All animals that arrived at the islands first floated, approached or sailed.

An increasingly popular option for those who plan a year of break during school is travel and learning.
It is especially popular with the last year students, as it offers them a free year before their studies without having to sacrifice their education.
It is often the case that education during a one -year stay abroad actually increases the likelihood of continuing the study of an individual in his home country.
Usually a tuition fee is required to participate in these educational programs.
The Hershey and Chase attempt was one of the main hints that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their own DNA into the bacterium using phags or viruses.
Two experiments were carried out to indicate the DNA in the Fag with radioactive phosphorus or the FAGA protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can be very different, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material and whether the calling cells are affected.
Only mutations of calling cells can be transmitted to children, and elsewhere mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
The life was lost by 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddback.He was driving Cuddback.

The Sphinx represents a background and is a narrator of a long story.
There are scenes on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
For the first time, the goats are expected to domesticate about 10,000 years ago in Mount Zagros in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Homemade goats were mostly in herds that were wandering through the hills or other grazing areas, and they were often taken care of by goat shepherds who were often children or adolescents, much like the more well -known sheep shepherds.These ways of managing herds are still used today.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by Lava from Nyiragonongo, which buried most of the streets and, above all, the city center.
Although the Goma is safe enough, it is necessary to explore excursions outside the Goma to understand the clashes that last in the province of the North Kiv.
This city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragonongo volcano and for some of the most favorable options for tracking mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can travel with BO-BODA (taxi-engine) after a mound.For a short ride at the usual (local) price, you will deduct about 500 Congor francs.

Members of the UN peacekeeping mission, who came to Haita after the 2010 earthquake, are to blame for the spread of the disease that began near the Chet Camp.
According to the lawsuit, the rehabilitation of waste from the UN camp was not appropriate, which caused the intake of bacteria into the tributary of the Artibonite River, which is one of the largest in Haiti.
Until the arrival of the troops, Haiti had not faced the problems associated with the disease since the 19th century.
The Haitian Institute of Justice and Democracy referred to independent research showing that the Nepalese Peace Forces have unknowingly transferred the disease to Haiti.
Danielle Lantagne, UN expert for this disease, stated that the outbreak was probably caused by peacekeepers.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works.This method actually conducts most scientific research.
But this is not all, but an important part of scientific research is also a test, where a test is a test aimed at eliminating one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observing.
Mohammed was very interested in things beyond this earthly life.He visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) to think.
The cave itself, which has spent the test of time, gives a very clear idea of Mohammed's spiritual aspirations.
The cave located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca is completely away from the rest of the world.
It is basically not easy to find, even if we know it exists.The interior of the cave, however, offers complete solitude.
Except for a clear, beautiful sky over the head and many surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen.From the inside of the cave you can see or hear little from this world.
In England, rails were built in the 16th century.
Although wagons were made up of parallel boards only, because of them, the horses they were pulling were able to reach higher speeds and pull higher burdens than on slightly worse roads at the time.
Quite soon, they began to use the thresholds to stay in place.Gradually, however, they found that the tracks were more efficient if they had an iron strip at the top.
This has become a universal practice, but due to iron, wooden wheels on wagons were faster.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron.In 1767, the first rails, which were entirely of iron, were introduced.
Cultural determinism, which drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was an important element of romance.
In the case of romance, individuals have formed geographical affiliation, and over time, customs and culture related to each geographical area, which were in harmony with the state of society and thus better than arbitrarily introduced laws, emerged.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological efforts or technological need to the idea of driven by the fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have the same general idea: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology, consequently, causes "effects" to companies that are previously inherent than socially conditioned.
For example, we could say that roads will surely develop with the development of the car.
However, the national road network cannot be economically justified for just a few cars, so new methods of manufacturing are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in health care for the care of damaged bodies.
It is confirmed that the strain of bird flu, which is deadly for humans, H5N1, infected a dead wild duck, which was found in a swamp near Lyon in the east of France on Monday.

The Hong Kong Island is called the Hong Kong territory and is the main outpost of many tourists.
The type of buildings that makes the silhouette of Hong Kong are associated with a shimmering column chart, emphasized by the presence of Victoria Harbor.
For the best views of Hong Kong, go from the island and head to the opposite coast of Kowloon.
Urban development in the Hong Kong Islands is largely concentrated on the re -annexed territory along the north coast.
This place was taken by the British colonialists as their own, so this is a good starting point to see the remains of the colonial past of the area if you are interested.
The former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by abducting their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his rifle M16.
Some hostages have been solved and at least six dead have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as the Philippine photographers.
The photographers replaced the older lady who had to go to the toilet.Mendoza was shot.
The streams support riders and hang on each side of the saddle.
The rider offers greater stability, but they can also be a problem in terms of security, as they can catch rider's legs.
If the horse throws his rider from himself and the rider's foot gets caught in strerms, the horse could pull him behind in the event of an escape.In order to reduce this risk, we can follow a series of precautions.
First, most riders carry riding boots with heel and smooth, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some of the saddles, especially the English saddles, have safety latches that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it back during the fall.
The "bow up" label looks like a letter V and for "bow down" as a clip or square without the underside.
Up means that you should start at the top of the arch and push it down, it means that you should start at the frog (hence where you hold your bow) and pull the bow.
The pulling of the arch from above usually creates a softer sound, while the arch of the arch is stronger and more determined from below.
If you wish, you can draw your arches with a pencil, but remember that the printed arches are listed for music, so they should be considered.

The 802.11n standard operates both at 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz.
As a result, it will be compatible with the standards of 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, if the basic station will have a double radio.
The speed of 802.11n is significantly higher than the speed of its predecessors with the maximum theoretical permeability of 600 Mbit/s.
The first examples of this disease this season were recorded in late July.
The disease is transmitted by pigs, and then mosquitoes transfer it to humans.
The outbreak is forced by the Indian government to take steps such as the referral of pig hunters in severely affected areas, the distribution of thousands of mosquito curtains and pesticide spraying.
The government has also promised millions of vials against encephalitis, which will help health agencies to prepare for next year.
For the planned supply of vaccines this year to the most affected areas, it was postponed due to lack of assets and low priorities compared to other diseases.
Indonesian food is a general name for a wide range of dishes there, which is found across the country, offering as many as 17,000 islands.
However, the concept without additional markers mostly means food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javan cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, is characterized by a type of simply spicy dishes, with the dominant flavors that are adored by the lobes, peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javan's coconut) and various aromatic spices.
Research from the twentieth century shows that there are two set of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the range of variations.
Separation and recombination with each generation redistribute variations here and there between the two sets.
Primat with a digestive system similar to human, with plant sources available in the savannah, is difficult to meet the needs of amino acids.
In addition, if this needs cannot be satisfied, there are serious consequences: lag in growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would be proteins present in leaves and legumes, which are difficult to digest if not cooked for primates, including us.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also a source of high quality protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, it should not surprise us if our ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in some extent the same way as they do today in the Savanna.
Subcultures combine like -minded people who are thought to be overlooked by social standards and allow them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures may vary in age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics of which the subculture is recognizable can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of the subculture often indicate their belonging to the recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and Argo.
One of the ways that are most commonly used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to come from some unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults during their growing up due to neglect, unfortunate circumstances or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "wolf" or wild children.Some wolf children were closed (usually their parents);In some cases, such a form of child abuse was the result of rejection of a child's severe mental or physical disability by their parents.
Before they were abandoned or escaped, wild children may have been subject to serious abuse or traumas in childhood.
Others are supposed to raise animals;For some, they say they lived in the wild themselves.
When wild children fully raise inhuman animals, their behavior (within physical restrictions) is almost exactly the same as the behavior of animals-suppliers, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Self -care agriculture is a term used for agriculture to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self -sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system that used saved seeds that originate from the same organic region, combined with crop rotation or other simple technique to ensure the best possible harvest.
In the past, most farmers have dealt with self -sufficient agriculture, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Plane accidents are common in Iran because they use an outdated fleet for both civil and military operations, which is poorly maintained.
Due to international sanctions, they could not buy new planes.
Earlier this week, a police helicopter crashed, with three people dying and three more were injured.
Last month, Iran experienced the worst aviation catastrophe of recent years, in which a plane was crashed into Armenia, killing all 168 people on board.
In the same month, another airline crossed the landing track and collided into the wall, killing seventeen people.
The Iraq Research Group presented its report today at 12.00 after GMT.
It warns that no one can ensure that measures in Iraq are stopped by sectaric warfare, an increase in violence, or a chaos in chaos.
The report begins with a call for open debate and formulate an agreement in the United States on Politics to the Middle East.

Other topics under consideration should cover the future situation of Jerusalem, which in both countries is considered to be holy and the problem of the Jordan River valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, and the Palestinian authorities have only agreed to five years of such presence.
Why would the organization undergo a time -consuming process of establishing a learning organization?The transfer of concepts of organizational learning into practice is, among other things, an innovation.
When operating departments of the organization effectively use available resources, creativity and ingenuity can begin.
Thus, in the process of cooperation within the organization, a new innovative procedure can be created to meet the needs of the clients.
Before a particular organization can become innovative, the management must establish an innovative environment and promote common knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the approach with continuity as a method used to help organizations in achieving a higher level of efficiency.
Travelers planning to have a gender change abroad must make sure that they have valid background documents with them.

Discontinue sleep is a procedure during which you are deliberately waking up during the usual sleep and falling asleep again (after 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will make you tooager but not awaken.
If you are going to reset your alarm clock, you can place it on the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking a large amount of liquids (especially water or tea, which is a well -known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing a person to get up and go to water.
According to the last post, sea level readings show that a tsunami was created.Some obvious activity tsunami was recorded near the towns of Pago Pago and Niue.
No major damage or injuries was reported in Tonga, but the electricity supply was suspended, which would prevent the Tonken authorities from receiving a warning about the tsunami triggered by the PTWC.
Fourteen schools in Hawaii, located on or near the coast, were closed all day, although all warnings were canceled.
Mariano shook the earthquake at 07:19 local time (on Friday at 9:19 PM GMT).

Virtual groups strive for the same standards of excellence as conventional groups, but there are small differences.
Virtual members of the group often act as a contact point for their direct natural group.
Usually, they have more freedom than ordinary members of the group, as their groups have to adapt to multiple time belts, for which their local leadership sometimes has no ear.
Another characteristic component of the virtual group is the presence of a true "invisible group" (Larson and Lafasto, 1989: 109).
The "invisible team" is a management team reported by individual members.The invisible team sets standards for each member individually.
When directors start to lead their former colleagues, it is generally considered that they can begin to behave in one of two ways.On the one hand, an effort is present to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
Such a leader has a hard time making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, assessing workers' efficiency, assigning tasks and requiring responsibility for errors.
On the other hand, we can turn into an unrecognizable individual who thinks that he has to change everything that the team has done and to draw on his own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the group.
Such behavior often creates gaps between leaders and other team members.
Content theories focus on finding what people are driven by or what pleases them.
These theories say that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize while growing up.
These theories are investigating what it is, which makes some people want the things they want and what things in the environment will prepare them to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are hierarchies of need for Maslow and Herzberg's two -factor motivational theory.
Women should wear skirts that extend across their knees when visiting monasteries, and should also have shoulders covered.
Most monasteries offer to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if there are vibrant colors, you will laugh a monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow you at the entrance, but you need to know that they are not washed after every use, so it may not be comfortable to wear them.Universal size is available for men.
If you go to Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience a polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
You will be offered a good opportunity to see the polar glow, as it is more or less all day at that time.
Because areas are rarely populated and mostly no problems with light pollution, you will also be able to admire the stars.
The car bomb, which was blown up at the police station in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other persons.

Former Speaker of the Newt Gingrich Representative Center, Texas Governor Rick Perry and Congress of Michele Bachmann finished fourth, fifth and sixth.
After the results were announced, Gingrich praised Santorum, and Romney devoted only sharp words, because he was played in Iowa by negative ads for a campaign against Gingrich.
Perry said he "return to Texas to evaluate the results of tonight's party elections to see if there is a way forward in this battle", but later said he would insist on the battle and participate on January 21rally in South Carolina.
Bachmann, who won the straw elections in August, decided not to continue the campaign.
In remote places without a mobile signal, you may only be able to use a satellite phone.
The satellite phone usually cannot replace the mobile phone, as you have to be outdoors and have an unobstructed sight view so you can make a call.
This service is often used in ship transport, including excursion vessels, as well as for expeditions that require service for distant data and speech.
A local telephone service provider can provide you with more information about connecting with this service.
The rule of thirds, which is often exploited and often ridiculed, is a simple guide that creates dynamism while providing a criterion for image arrangement.
According to it, the most effective place for the main object is at the cross section of the lines, which divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
For example, the most widely used photographic format for immovable images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of analog film.
It is still used today, but it is more important that its image ratio has also been taken over by the formats of the digital cameras image sensors.
The 35mm format actually-and somewhat unusual-measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The image ratio of this format (we divide by twelve to gain the most basic relationship in the form of a whole number) is therefore 3: 2.
Many of the usual formats (ASP Family Format) are the same or very close to that ratio between height and width.
He describes the show's website as "old school radio theater with a new and outrageous Piflar turn".

Robin Uthappa scored the highest number of points in the change, 70 runs with only 41 balls, with 11 bumps of four runs and 2 of six runs.
The middle order bumpers, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, performed well and reached a hundred in the game of a pair of bumpers.
After the loss of captain's doors, India has only reached 36 runs, losing the 7 -door period.
The Babylonians built each God the main temple, which is supposed to represent the home of an individual God.
People brought victims to the gods, and priests tried to quench the needs of the gods with rituals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner shrine, into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid towers, which are called zigurati and were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special refuge for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The life of the Hebrew family mostly took place in the open.
Women cooked in the yard;The shops were just open countertops facing the street.The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the country, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was rarely populated.The Nordic saga is said to have been expelled from Iceland due to the murder of Erik and that he discovered Greenland in his path to the west and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery, the tribes of Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between their people, kings, customs and history.
Although their food would mostly seem known to us, the Romans had quite strange or unusual holiday dishes, including a wild boar, peacock, snail and a species of rodent called the polh.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat on chairs, the rich men preferred to enjoy their meals together, lying on the side during dining.
Old Roman meals could not contain food that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, no tomatoes, potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans never tried turkey meat.
Civilization is a unique culture that is a common large group of individuals who live and participate, society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilians, which means civic and is related to the Latin word Civis, which means a citizen, and civitas, which means a city or urban state, which in some way also characterizes the size of society.
City countries are the precursors of nations.The culture of civilization involves giving knowledge through the generations, a permanent cultural trace and significant prevalence.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving important historical traces behind them, so they cannot be considered as true civilization.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is HonÅ¡u), making the seventh largest island in the world.
Due to a set/group of islands.which Japan has, from a geographical point of view, is often called "Archipelago"
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when it was called Ilha Formosa or a beautiful island by European seafarers sailing past the island.
In 1624, the Netherlands East Indian society erected a database in southwestern Taiwan and began the transformation of indigenous ways of producing cereals and the employment of Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the CHING Dynasties (1644-1912) took over control of the Taiwan west and north coast and declared Taiwan in 1885 as the provinces of the Ching Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the first Chinese-Japanese War (1894â1895), the Government of the Cinema Dynasty signed an agreement in Å imonosco, which handed power over Taiwan, Japan, which ruled on the island until 1945.
Mix the two powders and form them into a ball with clean moist hands.
The wet on the palms will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange feeling and the formation of a crust.
This is called pH of chemicals.You can already make the indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color according to acidity or basicity (alkaline) chemicals.
The pH value of the chemicals tested is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been deprived of electrons (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
The lions are the most social cats and live in large groups we call a herd.
There are one to three males related in the herd and up to thirty females and puppies.
As a large family of sisters and daughters, women are usually closely linked to each other.
The lion's herd behaves very much like a lump of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to the lions (but not other big cats) and also very deadly for their prey.
Below them are more medium -sized cats that eat medium prey, from rabbits to suede and deer.
There are also many small cats (including wildly living homemade cats) that feed on much more prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is in the concept of niches, a special work that an individual cat has, which protects it from competing with others.
Ozelots feed on small animals.If they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds.Almost all the animals hunted by Ozelot are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that Ozelots pursue and seek animals for food (prey) with the help of smell, as they smell where they have lingered on the ground.
Due to night vision, they can see very well at night and also move inaudibly.Ozelotes are preying so that they first blend with their surroundings and then jump to prey.
The tiger is a good athlete and can climb (though not best), swims, skips long distances and pulls five times stronger than a strong man.
Tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars.These four large cat representatives are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger roar is not as full and uniform as the lion, but more cut off and flashy.
Plants create oxygen that people breathe and accept carbon dioxide that people squeeze out of the lungs (or exhale).
Photosynthesis plants produce food with the help of the sun.They also offer shade.
We make our own houses and clothing from plants.Most of the food we eat are from plants.Animals could not survive without plants.
When a small group of living organisms (small population) away from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves via a mountain chain or river or moves to a new island and is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environmentAs she lived before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different qualities or adjustments to be able to deal with them.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
When the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it is less and less similar to another population.
Over time, over a thousand or even millions of years, the populations will seem so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called specialties, which means the formation of new species.Specialty is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
The insects were the first animals to take off.Due to the ability to fly, they avoided the enemies and searched for food and partner partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding wings along their body.
This gives them even more chances of hiding from predators.
Today, they are the only insects that cannot fold the wings against the body, dragonflies and day.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived and lives today.We call them birds.
Many people do not perceive them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, dinosaurs share a lot of similarities.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs and walk on the last two legs like tyrannosaures.
Mosazaver was the supreme predator of his time, so he was not afraid of anything but other Mosazavrov.
Its long jaw contained more than 70 extremely sharp teeth, and in the sky he had extra teeth, so he folded everything that crossed his path.
We do not have accurate data, but it can have a split tongue.He fed with turtles, large fish and other mosmas, maybe he was even cannibal.
He also attacked all the creatures that stepped into the water;Not even huge dinosaurs, such as tyrannosaures, have not been able to cope with it.

The Vatican is legislation and official communication in Italian.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most workers in the country, while in religious ceremonies they often use Latin.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, almost every house had a flush toilet, which was connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
The remains of the sewer system were found in houses in Mino cities in Crete and Santorin in Greece.
The toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China.In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women met in mixed societies.
The fission bomb works by requiring energy to combine the nuclei with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy trolley in the slope.Part of this energy is then released by re -cleaving the nucleus.
Some atoms have an unstable core, which means that they usually fall apart by themselves or almost without help.
Thus, the pencil was a dear friend of many when invented.
Unfortunately, new methods of writing have emerged and the pencil was pushed to the sideline.
People now write messages on computer screens and do not even approach the spike.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer appears.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then bounces it back down.
The satellite was sent to space by a rocket.Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
It takes a huge rocket over 100 feet to transport a satellite or telescope to space.
The bike completely changed the world.One of his most prominent contributions is faster and easier to transport.
It brought us a train, a car and many other forms of transportation.
The surface of the month consists of stones and dust.The outer layer of the month is called crust.
On the nearby side, the crust is about 70 km thick and 100 km on the distant.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker below the highlands.
More seas could be on the closer side as the crust is thinner.Lava has easily rose to the surface.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarh said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), was rotating around the earth.
This seems reasonable because we have no feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and at the same time the largest river on Earth.It contains more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
Amazon, whose areas are up to six miles wide, is also the widest river on Earth.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers, comes from Amazon.
The main river Amazon is 6387 km long (3980 miles).Thousands of smaller rivers pour into it.
Gold can be designed into many different shapes.It can be laid into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and knit.It may also be forged or rolled into the leaves.
It may be very thin and attached to other metals.Because it can be so thinly flattened, it was sometimes used to decorate hand paintings in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
The alloys are basically a mixture of two metals or more.Remember that there are many elements in the periodic system.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metal.Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non -metallic elements such as carbon.
In space, everything consists of a substance.The whole substance is made up of small particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that they could be put into trillion at the end of this sentence.
People know basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, from antiquity, since everything from them can be found in nature in the original form and can be quite easy to dig with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle designed the theory that everything consisted of a mix of four elements.These are earth, water, air and fire.
Basically, there were more four conditions of substances (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he claimed to turn into new substances and form what we see.
During the revolutionary war, thirteen countries, with the provisions on the confederation, first formed a weak central government - composed only by Congress.
Congress had no power to claim benefits, but since there was no national executive or judicial authority, he relied on state authorities for the implementation of his laws, which often did not want to participate.
In addition, he had no powers to annul tax laws and tariff between countries.
The consent of all states was required to supplement the articles, but individual federal countries did not seriously take the central authorities, so their representatives were often absent.
If you have watched the movie The Treasure Forgotten, you may think that on the back of the declaration of independence, a treasure map is drawn.
That is not true.Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a map of the treasure.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "The original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776" were written.The text is written at the bottom of the document facing the head.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the big document on the parchment (measuring 29 3/4 inches times 24 1/2 inch) was stored in the form of a roll at the beginning of its life.
Therefore, it is possible that the bookmark was simply added as a mark.
Mach Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the intahuatan, the solar tower and the shrine of three windows.
Most buildings at the edges of the complex were rebuilt to make tourists imagine how originally they looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the renovation continues today.
Although the construction of pyramids with stones continued to the end of the old kingdom, the size of the pyramids in Giza and the technical professionalism of their construction were never exceeded.
During the period of the new kingdom, the Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, who have been at the time for over a thousand years.
With disembarkation on Day D and the battles that followed, they liberated northern France, and the southerner was still unprecedented.
He was ruled by "altitude" French.These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the conquerors instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces were occupied by southern France, and the invasion was called "Dragoon Operation".
The Americans and French Free forces freed in southern France in just two weeks and focused on Germany.
Project administrator Commons Adam Cuerden expressed his disappointment over the erases last month in an interview with Wikinews.
"[Wales] has actually lied to us from the very beginning. First, because he behaved that the reasons for this were legal. Second, because he pretended to listen to us until the erasure of his artistic products."
The community dissatisfaction has led to current efforts to establish policy on the sexual content of the site, where millions of media content with an open license are hosted.
Anyone who will drive at high altitudes or across mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperature below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is bad and you cannot drive as if you were on the bare asphalt.
Among the snowstorms, there can be enough snow in a very short time to stay trapped.
Visibility can also be limited by the snow or snow carried by the wind, or due to condensate or ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, the ice and snow conditions in many countries are something common and traffic is mostly smooth throughout the year.
Work culture in Japan may be more hierarchical and formal, such as Westerners.
Dresses are a standard business uniform, and colleagues call each other by surname or title in the workplace.

Until September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was withdrawal and redistribution along the Romanian bridge.
These plans, however, became outdated virtually overnight, when 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union ran and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of the East Polish regions, which was contrary to the peace treaty from Riga, the Soviet-Polish-Polish non-collection pact and othersinternational treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Although many animals are accustomed to the presence of humans in the park, wild animals are still wild, and therefore should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the Park Management Board, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife.
Bison, Canadian deer, moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack them to look so meek.
Dozens of visitors are damaged every year because they do not maintain a sufficient distance.These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them alone.
In addition, you need to know that the scents attract bears and other wild animals, so do not wear or cook food with a strong odor and keep clean in the camp.
