State judge: government general orders cannot be so extensive.
Government general orders, which have established various restrictions and rules during the coronavirus pandemic, should be of limited scope, said Supreme Court Justice Ivo Pilving.
"We referred to one border, and the Tallinn Circuit Court has also referred to it, that the general orders of governments - by which all requirements for a corona pass are currently established - that their limit must eventually end."
Because the nature of general administration is such that its legal scope must still be somehow limited.
He cannot be as universally applicable as a law.
"And if it is not otherwise restricted, such as for a certain group of individuals or something similar, then it must be restricted in terms of time," said the Chairman of the Administrative Law Chamber of the Supreme Court Pilving at a press conference held on Thursday.
I cannot take a position right now whether that time has already passed today or will pass tomorrow or the day after tomorrow - these disputes are already in the courts and the truth will be revealed there.
But there is also a limit for the government in using this instrument, and here the criticism of the complainants is to some extent correct, that the legislator cannot completely distance themselves from these topics," Pilving continued.
Government general order is a special type of administrative act, which can only be challenged in court by each individual separately, and the corresponding court decision does not apply to all objects of restriction, but only to the person who challenged it.
The widespread use of general orders has been criticized by former Chancellor of Justice Allar Jõks.
The Supreme Court judge emphasized, however, that the dispute, for which the Supreme Court announced its decision on Thursday, is still different.
This concerns one - albeit very special, but still one institution, the defense forces - and here the legal framework is slightly more relaxed, because it does not concern everyone.
"This concerns Estonian men and women working in the defense forces, and according to current understanding, the requirements can also be established by the head of the respective institution for a limited group of individuals based on the Occupational Health and Safety Act," said Pilving.
He explained that the previous practice of the Supreme Court indicates that the more extensive, profound, and intensive a restriction or obligation is, the more work the parliament must put into it.
"Until the point that some obligations are such that they must be finally regulated by law," noted the Supreme Court judge.
"But on the other hand, when it comes to the topic of vaccination and the pandemic, which comes in waves and requires quick response, it again speaks in favor of executive decision-making power and government decision-making power."
"And even when we talk about institutions and the requirements placed on the people working in them, according to the understanding of the Supreme Court today, there is room for the orders of the leaders of those institutions, if the conditions are met," he added.
French fishermen are blocking traffic in the English Channel to demand fishing rights.
French fishermen are blocking ferry traffic in three ports in the English Channel on Friday to demand post-Brexit fishing rights, as well as blocking freight traffic in the tunnel between France and the United Kingdom, the union announced.
The chairman of the French National Committee for Fisheries (CNPMEM), Gerard Romiti, described the protest as a warning signal and said that traffic will be blocked at the ports of Saint-Malo, Ouistreham, and Calais, as well as in the Eurotunnel for several hours.
The long-standing dispute between the United Kingdom and France over fishing permits is still unresolved and threatens to escalate into a full-scale trade war.
"We don't want donations, we just want our promises back."
"The United Kingdom must adhere to the post-Brexit agreement," said Romiti.
"We have been holding our breath for 11 months."
The patience of professionals has limits.
"We hope that this warning shot will be taken into account," he said, not ruling out further actions.
France has threatened to ban British fishing vessels from unloading their catch in French ports and impose stricter controls on all British imports.
According to President Emmanuel Macron, such measures are expected to provide an opportunity for negotiations, but French officials emphasize that all options are still on the table.
The negotiations between French Minister for European Affairs Clement Beaune and British Brexit Minister David Frost have not yielded results so far.
According to last year's agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union, European fishing vessels can continue fishing in British waters if they can prove that they have done so before.
According to Paris, the applications of several French ships have been unjustifiably rejected.
London denies it.

Vambola Paavo | Let's establish a maximum price for gasoline, following the example of Hungary.
I happened to listen to the radio show "The Prime Minister is in the Studio" a month ago.
When the reporter asked Kaja Kallas how much a liter of fuel costs at gas stations, silence followed.
The Prime Minister hesitantly announced, "I don't know."
At a time when energy carriers are becoming more expensive worldwide, the prime minister should know how much everything costs!
Therefore, he has unrealistic and bad advisors.
On the contrary, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban knows it very well.
Hungary fixed fuel prices nationally for three months.
They must not be more than 500 forints or 1.42 euros per liter at gas stations.
Currently, the fixed price for three months is 480 forints, which is 1.37 euros per liter.
Hindu is reviewed every three months.
The accelerated inflation prompted the establishment of the upper limit, and it is the highest in the country in nine years - 6.5 percent.
According to the decision, gas station chains can sell cheaper, but not more expensive.
CHINESE MEDICINE RECOMMENDS: this plant should now be in every home!
In autumn-winter, when it is damp and wet outside, it is necessary to strengthen and warm the body.
Several medicinal plants are suitable for this purpose, as they keep the warmth inside but prevent excessive heat from forming.
It is very convenient to put both plants and hot water in a thermos, take it to work or school, and drink supportive tea throughout the day, as recommended in the Health Alchemy blog.
When the road ends, boiling water can be added to the plants multiple times.
TALLINN REMOTE LEARNING WAS POINTLESS!
School rapid testing yielded the same good result!
The four-week distance learning for grades 4-8 in Tallinn schools did not give the city an advantage in combating the coronavirus, as the rapid tests achieved equivalent results in areas with open schools, confirmed by dry figures.
Distance learning took place in Pärnu for a shorter period of time and partially in Narva, but in Tallinn it started immediately after the school break and lasts for a total of four weeks.
The scientists analyzing the coronavirus now have an excellent comparison base between Tallinn and the rest of Estonia.
After future national exams, for example, it will be possible to observe whether four weeks of absence from school also means poorer results compared to the rest of the country.
But now the most important question is whether Tallinn's decision to switch municipal schools to distance learning has brought the city greater success in the fight against the coronavirus.
There was friction between the mayor Mihhail Kõlvart due to his actions between Toompea and the lower town.
ANU SÄÄRITS HONESTLY ABOUT LIFE: objectivity and courage to stand tall are important, and not underestimating oneself or others.
From her childhood home, Anu has acquired the knowledge that no matter what, one must manage to get by.
"I come from a big family."
In our family, mother practically took care of five children alone, we couldn't make any demands.
"I had to grow up quickly myself in order to somehow realize my interests."
Curiosity has indeed been the driving force for familiar Anu Säärits (49) in sports news and broadcasts since childhood.
"Quite early on, I noticed that hey, something interesting is happening in Tallinn!"
"I decided to hitchhike from Tartu to get there, take a look around, and only tell my family when I returned that I went," the woman chuckles about her former determination, which repeatedly led her to explore further.
Mart Seim: I am the only super heavyweight weightlifter from Estonia who has not been caught using banned substances at the Rio Olympics.
Estonia's most successful weightlifter Mart Seim and his colleague Leho Pent are preparing for the upcoming World Championships in two weeks.
If their favorite sport remains in the Olympic program, both of them want to compete at least until the 2024 Paris Games.
The pursuit of participating in the Tokyo Olympics this summer was hindered by the coronavirus that both Mardi and Leho contracted in the spring, which confined them to their sickbeds and prevented them from regaining their athletic form for the European Championships.
Reader's note | Cry for help: only flailing legs were visible from the shopping cart.
A man saved a child who had gotten stuck between the goods in a shopping cart.
Is a child's place even in a shopping cart?!
"I was on my weekly shopping trip and was just turning between the cold counters when two flailing legs appeared in front of my eyes."
At first, I didn't understand what was happening, but then I realized that there is a child in the shopping cart.
I can't say for sure, but most likely the toddler tried to crawl out feet first from between the piles of food.
Or maybe he had indeed gotten uncomfortably stuck between the goods and while trying to adjust himself, he ended up completely upside down," Siim describes the scene that unfolded in the store.
The poet put domestic nut producer's nuts into Santa Claus' gift bag.
Candies, various candy bars, and chocolate bars - seems like a typical choice for Santa Claus' gift bag or a Christmas elf's stocking?
In reality, they are not healthy at all.
Instead, one could delight a child or a loved one during the Christmas period with something healthy.
Different nuts, almonds, and seeds are beneficial for health.
Some may furrow their brows, saying that nuts also contain a lot of fats - couldn't they be equated with candies then?
No, definitely not.
If you read the label on a package of nuts, you can see that the fats in nuts consist almost entirely of healthy and essential unsaturated fatty acids for the body, with a small amount of saturated fatty acids and no trans fats at all.
Fats are beneficial for our body and should not be completely avoided.
However, it is important to prefer unsaturated fatty acids, or good fats, which can be obtained from nuts, seeds, and almonds.
Therefore, the only Estonian nut producer, Germund Hulgi, recommends choosing healthy snacks for the Christmas holidays.
Especially popular are Germund Hulgi's black color Premium packs, which contain the largest nuts and dried fruits.
For example, hazelnuts come from Georgia, almonds from California, raisins and cranberries from Chile, and cashews from Vietnam.
Roasting, salting, mixing into delicious blends, and packaging, however, takes place in Estonia.

Bercman Technologies' stock price has experienced a noticeable decline.
On the Baltic First North list, Bercman Technologies' stock has fallen from 9 euros to 8.6 euros in the last day, which means a decrease of 4.44%.
Compared to the fall on November 24th from 11.4 euros to 9 euros (-21.05%), Bercman's stock price is currently stabilizing.
Even ELMO Rent's stock has declined after the good news at the beginning of the week.
As of today, the stock has fallen to 5.03 euros (-2.9%).
On the other hand, Baltic First North is seeing an increase in K2 LT to 31.2 euros (2.63%), and MADARA Cosmetics also experienced a slight rise of 0.71% to 28.2 euros.
In the Baltic main list, the biggest gainers of the day are Panevezio statybos trestas, rising to 0.7 euros (5.74%), and SAF Tehnika, rising to 12.5 euros (3.73%).

The new gym in Kohtla-Järve is getting extremely expensive coat hangers with the help of state funds.
In the list of tangible expenses of the newly opened Kohtla-Järve Wiru Sports Center this year, the cost of the lockers in the gym's changing room stands out particularly.
The manager of the sports center justifies the high prices of lockers by saying that they want to be the most modern.
"You can't say that I'm not a woman."
Special sprint girl, who completed 100 meters from a flying start in 9.86 seconds.
Naturally high in testosterone, Namibian sprinters Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi do not fit within the usual boundaries and continue to raise new questions.
During the Tokyo Olympics, Estonians were able to cheer for Maicel Uibo's wife Shaunae Miller-Uibo as she successfully defended her title in the 400-meter race.
The victory was overwhelming, but to be fair, all possible challengers fell off for one reason or another, and the slender Bahamian woman had to win.
Figuratively speaking, the path to the gold medal was swept clean with a broom.
Two years earlier at the Doha World Championships, Bahraini quarter-miler Salwa Eid Naser, who surprisingly took first place ahead of Miller-Uibo, received a punishment due to undisclosed doping test results.
A new super talent, 19-year-old Athing Mu, who grew up in America, chose the 800m distance, where she became the Olympic champion.
And this year, the World Athletics (WA) banned Namibian sprinters (Christine Mboma ran a time of 48.54 and Beatrice Masilingi ran a time of 49.53), who have shown very fast times, from participating in the 400m distance due to excessively high testosterone levels.
And what will happen next?
Mboma and Masilingi, who came second and sixth in the 200m race in Tokyo, still continue to create disagreements.
No one seems to be satisfied.
Some think that they have been discriminated against, some believe that this duo should not compete among women at all.
The topic requires a solution as quickly as possible because, according to observers, it is only a matter of time before Mboma, with a very poor start but unprecedented top speed, starts setting world records.
The government made an exception: more spectators will be allowed for the Estonia-Israel qualifying match.
The government considered the men's basketball World Cup qualifying match between the national teams of Estonia and Israel, which will take place this Sunday in Saku Suurhall in Tallinn, as events of overwhelming public interest and allows up to 3360 spectators for the game.
According to the current restrictions, starting from November 15th, up to 1000 spectators are allowed to participate in indoor sports competitions.
The Health Board supports the event taking place with an increased number of spectators if the organizer mitigates the risk of the spread of the coronavirus according to the submitted plan, the government announced on its website.
Spectators would be divided into four zones in Saku Suurhall and they would not come into contact with each other, players, or the game-serving staff.
Access to the event is only granted upon presenting a COVID certificate, and mask-wearing will be checked on-site.
In sectors, it has been taken into account that people are located dispersedly and separate ventilation is provided for each area.
The use of horns and similar devices is prohibited.
The Estonian Basketball Association provides advance notice that spectators should arrive at the game in good time to avoid queues at the entrance during the verification of proofs and documents.
The doors will be opened one hour before the start of the event.
In total, there are 14 different entrances open for the four levels.
The Estonian national team starts the 2023 World Cup qualifying series on Thursday evening, facing Germany in Nuremberg.
Tickets for the Sunday game with Israel can be purchased from Piletitasku.
The food had already been ordered and the invitations sent: the Finns decided to cancel the presidential ball at the last moment.
The office of the Finnish President announced today that for the second year in a row, the traditional Independence Day presidential ball will be canceled.
The decision was essentially delayed until the last moment because the event was supposed to take place on December 6th.
This means that a lot of working hours have already been dedicated to organizing the ball.
Some time ago, invitations were sent out and drinks and food were also ordered.
According to the office, nothing goes to waste, but they can be used for future events.
The invitations sent out this time will also be valid for a year, writes Iltalehti.
"The preparations for the reception took into account the small number of guests, and therefore fewer things were reserved for the event," said the representative of the office.
The reason for the cancellation of the ball is the same as it was last year.
Specifically, there is concern due to the increase in coronavirus infections.
However, President couple Sauli Niinistö and Jenni Haukio have found a way to celebrate Independence Day with their people.
On December 6th, the president and the first lady will give an interview to Yle directly from the palace.
Several well-known musicians will also perform within the same transfer.
Great role model: Anett Kontaveit doesn't sit idle during her vacation and helps those in need.
After a tiring tournament in Mexico, the Estonian top tennis player took a little break and is resting in their homeland.
But during that time, he helps those who need assistance.
Anett Kontaveit does not rest idle, but uses this time practically.
He posted pictures on Instagram, calling himself a "plant mom", growing indoor plants at home.
And also engages in charity work, increasing awareness about the activities of the Shelter Association.
Anett posted pictures of dogs on social media, saying that she will also help them this year.
At the press conference on Monday, Anett Kontaveit said that she has been considering setting a goal of winning a Grand Slam tournament.
"I have been thinking about it for a couple of days."
Of course, my dream is to win a grand slam, but the most important thing is that the goals are based on development.
I want to improve my game and certain tennis elements, as well as my physique.
"If this development process is positive, better results will also come," he said through Delfi Sport.
Kontaveit thanked the fans who stayed up late in the past few weeks to support her during her matches in Mexico: "It has been very heartwarming to see how many people have been cheering me on."
I have received so much positive feedback and I am very grateful to everyone who cares about what I do.
"Thank you also to the supporters and sponsors, thanks to whom I have made it here."
After a short break, Kontaveit starts preparing for the new season in Tallinn and as the Australian tournaments approach, she flies to a warmer place to acclimatize.

Singer Jessie J lost a child: I lack control over my own emotions.
A well-known musician recently broke up with his partner, Max Pham, but decided to carry the pregnancy to term and raise their child together as a single mother.
Unfortunately, during the recent examination, doctors were unable to detect the baby's heartbeat, Jessie J revealed in a post made on Instagram.
"Yesterday morning, I laughed with a friend, asking them: 'Seriously though, how can I do the performance in LA tomorrow evening without telling the whole audience that I'm pregnant?'," wrote the singer.
"For lunch, I struggled with the thought of how I will manage this performance without collapsing."
During the third check-up of my pregnancy, I was told that the baby's heart is no longer beating.
This morning.
I have a feeling that I lack control over my emotions.
I may regret making this post later.
"I really don't know."
Despite being in deep grief at the moment, the woman has decided to go ahead with her performance in Los Angeles, believing that it will help her.
"I want to sing tonight."
"Not because I avoid grieving or the whole process, but because I know that singing tonight will help me," he said.
"I have only done two concerts in the past two years and my soul needs it."
Today more than ever.
I know that some people say that I should give it up, but at the moment, one thing is clear for me.
I started singing at a young age because it makes me happy, fills my soul, and acts as therapy.
This hasn't changed and I have to live things through in this way.
Jessie J revealed that she decided to raise the child alone because she was really looking forward to becoming a mother.
He knows that life is short and getting pregnant was a miracle and an experience that he will never forget.
She hopes to be able to get pregnant again in the future, but right now she is still in shock and extremely sad.
"But I know that I am strong and I know that everything will be fine," she added.
"I also know that millions of women around the world have felt this pain and even worse."
Make small footprint candles yourself.
Whoever lights candles before the holidays, should try Nordic and natural rapeseed wax.
Wax made from rapeseed seeds is a renewable and environmentally friendly raw material.
It is the time for annual candle making.
Candles can be made in spring and summer as well, but this activity is especially suitable for autumn.
Outside it is dim and rainy, the wind is howling.
At the same time, candle wax is melting in a pot on the stove and filling the room with wonderful aromas.
These are magical moments.
Our ancestors made candles from valuable lamb fat and they were only used on special occasions.
Nowadays, there are many different materials and tools available for making candles.
Navigating in these can cause confusion.
A new strange beauty trend is spreading on TikTok: women are using lubricant as a makeup primer.
TikTok users are once again introducing a new beauty trend, suggesting replacing the makeup primer in your cosmetic bag with the lubricant used in the bedroom.
Johannes Vares' sad fate: was it a suicide or was he eliminated from life?
Did Johannes Vares kill himself mainly to be quicker than death?
Was he forced or scared into committing suicide?
Or was removed from life because he started resisting not physically, but mentally...
Peeter Olesk reflects on the life and death of Vares-Barbarus in his latest piece of writing.
When Johannes Vares, also known as Johannes Barbarus (12th Jan. 1890-29th Nov. 1946), was found dead in the bathroom of his official apartment in Kadriorg early in the morning, he certainly didn't shave with a pocket knife, but most likely with a shaving razor, some cream, and a shaving brush.
The morning toilet couldn't have been difficult or painful because he probably shaved every day, but of course he had various types of cologne at the mirror, and there were also liquids to remove the bloody marks from the cuts.
The question is whether he wrote two pre-death letters before standing in front of the mirror or after that, with his chin already shaved.
The answer to the question would help us clarify at what time Johannes Vares lost his sleep on the morning of the day of his death, how much time he had to write farewell letters, and where he did it.
Desk, white sheets of paper, ink pot, and quill are not ordinary things in the bathroom!
It takes about an hour to write two quite long and at the same time extremely personal letters.
It could take about twenty minutes for shaving, brushing teeth, and rinsing the mouth, but what Johannes Vares could not know was the length of time after which he would be searched for and who would find his dead body first.
Taking these circumstances into account, I am inclined to believe that the farewell letters were ready before death arrived, at the latest on the evening of the previous day.
Therefore, they were written consciously, not emotionally.
According to the oral message from Nigol Andresen, Johannes Vares did not want to live as a disabled person at the end of his life.
This could imply that he knew the course of his illness.
However, the word "invaliid" may not necessarily mean a visibly noticeable disability, it can also mean a loss of working ability or being released from work due to health reasons as an excuse.
In Nõmme, a stack of books hid a murder victim.
The case is in the hands of the investigators of "cold murders".
The police received an unusual call in 2019 to Lemmiku Street in Nõmme: during the renovation of an old house, it was discovered that a dead body had been hidden under a neatly stacked pile of books in one of the rooms.
How is this possible?
Investigators have visited an elderly lady twice, but there hasn't been a clear enough moment yet to answer the question.
Mrs. may hold the key to a murder: according to one source, she once said years ago that her son may be guilty of a crime.
Gas instead of brakes.
Controversial factory laid its cornerstone despite the ongoing court dispute.
"Government members said this summer that they will not start building the factory until there is a court decision."
Finally, the oil factory received the cornerstone with the approval of the ministers last Tuesday.
On November 16th, Eesti Energia laid the cornerstone for the shale oil plant Enefit280, for which the government allocated 125 million euros of taxpayer money to the state-owned company for its construction. Climate activists sued the construction of the plant.
The more attentive ones remember that just half a year earlier, the Tartu Circuit Court suspended the construction permit for the factory as a preliminary injunction, and Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that a clear message was sent to Eesti Energia: the brakes must be applied to the construction of the factory until the end of the court dispute.
In November, however, Eesti Energia hit rock bottom with gas and started construction.
Legally, Eesti Energia does indeed have the right to start construction of the factory, as the Tartu Circuit Court cancelled the construction ban on the oil plant in early June.
However, the company took a business risk by laying the cornerstone for the factory, as the dispute over the legality of the building permit is still ongoing.
"In case the factory buildings and facilities are erected by the end of the court dispute, but the complaint is satisfied and the construction permit is declared invalid, the further course of events depends on the reasoning of the courts."
"It is entirely possible for a situation where buildings are found to be illegal, and theoretically there is a possibility that they will have to be demolished," explained Kärt Vaarmari, a lawyer from the Center for Environmental Law.
The only Australian in Lääne County teaches Estonians to eat grass.
Matthew Hill, who moved from Australia to Estonia, together with his wife Piret, established an organic seedling plantation in Jaagu Farm in Lääne County.
The family grows about ten different types of shoots there all year round and received the title of the best organic producer.
Look here, what else is being talked about in the latest issue of Maaleht!
Matthew Hill, who moved from Australia to Estonia, established an organic nursery in Lääne County together with his wife Piret.
In his vegetable beds, the owner practices sustainable agriculture, which is already very popular elsewhere in the world: the beds are not dug, only lightly aerated.
The Hill family's innovative ideas and methods in vegetable farming have attracted attention, earning them the title of the best organic producer this year.
German scientists are teaching cows to use the toilet.
Results can change the world.
A small herd of cattle in Germany has learned an impressive habit.
They use the area with artificial grass limited by a fence as a toilet.
But why is such training necessary?
Approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities worldwide come from cattle.
German scientists are trying to develop an unbelievably seeming solution to make cattle farming more environmentally friendly.
Prosecutor on the case of the man who killed a woman: he regretted his actions and voluntarily sought help.
We wrote on Wednesday about a case where Kiur, who mistreated a woman and accidentally caused her death, was sentenced to two years of imprisonment with a probation period of three years and three months.
This means that the man, as of now, has to spend only two days behind bars.
According to district prosecutor Kelly Kruusimägi, such a punishment is justified because Kiur regretted the act and voluntarily sought help for his problems.
We publish the prosecutor's comment.
Based on the evidence collected during the pre-trial investigation, it was determined that Kiur hit the woman once in the face and the victim's death occurred approximately two days later.
The evidence confirms that immediately after the impact and in the following two days, the woman communicated with Kiur.
The woman left the apartment the next day, moved around, and according to Kiur's statements, she did not understand that the woman may have suffered a health injury that could be dangerous and require medical intervention.
Evaluating the entire event, it is vital to believe, as a woman who abuses alcohol, she could also typically move with certain coordination disorders.
Also, the victim was not bloody or complained about anything unusual after the blow.
Therefore, we did not identify any intention to kill and the evidence did not indicate a desire to cause life-threatening harm.
Kiur does not have any valid criminal convictions.
He admitted to hitting the victim and regretted his actions and not understanding the need to call an ambulance.
He voluntarily sought help for his alcohol problem and he is employed.
Taking into account all these circumstances, but above all the specific act and the man's previous behavior, the prosecution requested a two-year prison sentence, which will not be enforced if Kiur does not commit a new crime during the longer probation period of three years and three months.
Probation is a period during which a person must prove that they will live lawfully in the future, which is one of the goals of punishment.
All parties, including the victim's mother, agreed with this solution, who also stated that she does not believe Kiur wanted the woman's death.
Day in traffic: Three vehicles were involved in an accident in Tallinn city center.
Yesterday morning, three cars were involved in an accident in the city center of Tallinn, one of which was parked by the street.
At 9:53, a traffic accident occurred at the intersection of Pronksi Street and Gonsiori Street in Tallinn, where, according to preliminary information, a 38-year-old man was driving an Audi R8 and collided with an Audi Q7 driven by a 44-year-old woman.
As a result of the collision, the Audi R8 was thrown against the stationary Ford Tourneo car.
The driver of the Audi Q7 was taken to East Tallinn Central Hospital.
The exact circumstances of the accident are being investigated.
At 15:20, a 48-year-old woman driving a Mercedes-Benz car in Võru city hit a 75-year-old woman who was crossing the road near the house at Jüri street 46.
The driver took the pedestrian to Võru Hospital for a check-up.
During the last 24 hours, one driver under the influence of drugs and one driver under the influence of alcohol were caught.
A gray 2004 Volvo V40 with license plate number 789BSN was stolen from the jurisdiction of the Southern Prefecture.
Ülo Kalm: A new powerful hospital was promised in the elections.
Money comes from Brussels, but where do the workers and equipment come from?
How can a mayor, whose father is Ülo and mother is Liidia, manage the leadership of a multicultural city?
It was sad and funny how the former mayor Savisaar believed that trust is eternal and he presented himself again as a candidate for parliament.
The star had gone out.
That trust is already proving to be more important than language and nationality is shown by the election results in Narva.
Doctors must fight against charlatans who offer opinions instead of facts in order to gain trust.
In addition, gentlemen who do not trust our healthcare system at all have also appeared in the spotlight (more specifically, in the columns of the newspaper).
I just read a confession of a gentleman from the city about his experiences in PERH.
Alo Raun: congratulations, 55% support the cohabitation law!
55% - today, according to opinion polls, there is an absolute majority support for the cohabitation law, when looking at 18-year-old and older Estonian citizens who have an opinion on this matter.
Perhaps people who can also choose the parliament and participate in a referendum.
This is revealed by the consolidated results of the September and October surveys conducted by Norstat and commissioned by the Liberal Citizen Foundation.
According to the same survey, such a trend has been going on for a while.
So when we talk about what "the people want", it is no longer correct to say that we/they are against the cohabitation law.
A new and "truly terrifying" variant of the coronavirus, B.1.1.529, was detected in Botswana.
A new variant of the coronavirus, B.1.1.529, with as many as 32 spike protein mutations, has been detected in Botswana, and it is not yet known if existing antibodies in humans can effectively respond to it.
So far, only a handful of infections with this variant have been registered through sequencing - three in Botswana, six in South Africa, and one in Hong Kong.
Therefore, scientists hope that the COVID cases caused by the new variant of the virus are not widespread, writes Sky News.
Virologist Tom Peacock from Imperial College London described the abundance of mutations discovered in the variant as "truly terrifying".
Envelope proteins are what viruses use to enter human cells, and the principle behind most vaccines is to train the human body to recognize and neutralize them.
Therefore, spike protein mutations can prove problematic for mRNA vaccines.
London University professor Francois Balloux said that the new variant should be carefully monitored and its spread analyzed.
"But there is no reason to worry excessively, unless its occurrence rate increases in the near future," he said.
The professor added that the abundance of mutations in B.1.1.529 may be due to it "evolving during a chronic illness of an immunocompromised person, possibly an untreated HIV/AIDS patient."
The first cases of infection with this variant were detected in Botswana on November 11th and three days later in South Africa.
In Hong Kong, a 36-year-old man was found who had a negative PCR test before flying from Hong Kong to South Africa, where he stayed from October 22nd to November 11th.
He had a negative test upon returning to Hong Kong, but on November 13th, the test result was already positive.
The Guardian writes that some South African virologists are already concerned, especially considering the recent increase in the number of cases in Gauteng, where B.1.1.529 cases have been detected.
Cambridge University's Professor of Clinical Microbiology, Ravi Gupta, told the publication that in his laboratory, it was found that two mutations in B.1.1.529 increased the virus's infectivity and reduced its recognition by antibodies.
European Commission: vaccination certificates should be valid for travel for 9 months, indefinitely after a booster dose.
The European Commission has just proposed to member states to establish deadlines for the validity of vaccination certificates for travelers between European Union countries.
According to the proposal, the standard validity period for the vaccination certificate issued after the initial vaccination cycle should be at least 9 months.
This means that member states should not refuse to recognize a vaccination certificate confirming that less than 9 months have passed since the administration of the final dose of primary vaccination when checking passengers.
As for booster doses, according to the Commission's proposal, the 9-month validity period should not apply to certificates issued after the booster dose.
This means that at least initially, the evidence obtained after the booster dose should be valid indefinitely.
"It is possible that the protection lasts longer after a booster dose than after the initial vaccination, which is why the commission is closely monitoring new scientific data on this matter."
"On this basis, the Commission may later propose to establish an appropriate validity period for vaccination certificates issued after the booster dose," the Commission noted.
To allow sufficient time for the implementation of the new regulations, the commission proposes to start applying the updates from January 10, 2022.
Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders noted at today's press conference that only vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency are accepted, and therefore the evidence issued in Hungary, for example, where people have been administered the Russian Sputnik or Chinese vaccines, does not apply.
In the EU, over 650 million vaccination certificates have been issued to date.
The Commission also found that, regardless of the EU region they are arriving from, individuals with a valid EU digital COVID certificate should generally not be subject to testing, quarantine, or other additional restrictions.
People who do not have an EU digital COVID certificate could be allowed to travel based on a test conducted before or after arrival.
The EU traffic light map will be updated as follows: the new case indicator will be considered together with the vaccination rate of the region.
No restrictions should be applied to passengers arriving from green areas.
On the contrary, in the case of dark red areas, considering the large number of infected individuals, it is advisable to avoid traveling in both directions, and travelers who are not vaccinated or have not recovered from the disease should be required to undergo testing and quarantine.
Exceptions should be applied to cross-border commuters, children under 12 years old, and people with essential travel needs.
According to the commission's assessment, the list of people with an unavoidable need to travel should be limited, as many of the passengers currently on the list have had the opportunity to get vaccinated in the meantime.
Chinese company: the Riigikogu (Estonian Parliament) adopted a discriminatory and competition-damaging law.
Chinese technology company Huawei does not hide the fact that it does not like the electronic communications act adopted by the Riigikogu yesterday - it allegedly gives the executive power the opportunity to discriminate against entrepreneurs solely based on the location of their headquarters in the country.
"According to the law, it can be assumed that obtaining a permit for the use of hardware and software from a manufacturer based in a country outside the European Union, NATO, or OECD may prove significantly more complicated than in the case of a manufacturer whose headquarters are located in a member state of the aforementioned organizations," said Ben Chang Bin, the head of Huawei Technologies Estonia.
According to Huawei's statement, the presumed association of the hardware and software manufacturer used in the communication network with a specific country is not justified, as all large companies operate internationally and their supply chains resemble each other.
According to the company's assessment, the security of technology can be ensured through "transparent and proportionate measures, avoiding unjustified discrimination of market participants and without harming competition."
According to the new version of the Electronic Communications Act, the Building Code Act, and the State Fees Act, the government has the right to impose an obligation on a telecommunications operator to apply for a permit for the use of hardware and software in the communication network in order to ensure national security.
The granting of this permit also goes through security agencies.
The prohibition applies to cases of hardware and software, the list of which is so long that it is unlikely that there is a country or manufacturer in the whole world that could meet the requirements set by Estonia.
For example, it is enough that the company has delivery difficulties, a cyber attack has been organized from its home country, or some product has security vulnerabilities.
The location or headquarters of the manufacturer is in a country that is not a member of the European Union, NATO, or OECD.
The principles of a democratic rule of law or human rights are not followed or respected in the country of origin of the manufacturer.
In the producer's country of origin, the intellectual property, personal data, or trade secrets of individuals from other countries are not protected.
The manufacturer's country of origin behaves aggressively in cyberspace.
The producer's country of origin has attributed cyber attacks to EU, NATO, or OECD member states.
The manufacturer is subject to the jurisdiction of the host country or another foreign country's government or public authority without independent judicial control.
The country of origin or any foreign country may require the producer to act in a manner that endangers the security of the Estonian state.
The manufacturer's economic activity is not based on market-based competition or sufficient conditions have not been created for it in the host country.
The ownership structure, organizational structure, or management structure of the producer is not transparent.
The funding of the producer is not transparent.
The manufacturer's products or services contain security vulnerabilities and sufficient security measures have not been implemented to eliminate them.
The manufacturer is not consistently able to ensure the delivery of products or services, except in cases of force majeure.
After the decision of the Riigikogu, Estonia can finally announce the 5G frequency auction for telecommunications companies.
Estonia is last in the European Union in terms of implementing 5G.
Mihkel Raud on social media about corona speculations: it's like 15 minutes of fame, on which it's easy to elicit sympathy from others.
"Life is what happens when you have other plans," said a wise man once.
This man was probably John Lennon.
Although we tend to attribute brilliant quotes to people we like the most, it may happen that someone else said those wise words instead of Lennon.
But the core of the sentence changes very little, of course.
I had beautiful plans.
I had to perform with Singer Vinger in Sindi, then take the bus back to Tallinn and participate in the "Estonia's Got Talent" final show the next day - just like I had performed, traveled, and participated countless times over the past dozen years.
But life got ahead of my plans.
"I don't feel very well, maybe we should go straight to the city?" I tried to persuade Singer Vinger's companions to give up another forest stop.
We had already made three of them.
The bus turned into the forest, men were smoking outside, and I felt how the fever was rising every second.
And if you now think that you have stumbled upon another COVID rant, you are only partially right.
Family doctor warns: flu is spreading!
It is a serious illness, it is not just a cold and cough.
How to protect yourself?
There is a lot of talk about the coronavirus, its prevention, and treatment.
Next to this, it tends to be forgotten that during the autumn-winter season, there are many different respiratory viruses circulating, and the flu has already reached Estonia, so it is high time to protect oneself from the virus, says Triinu-Mari Ots, the director and family doctor of Laagri Family Health Center, giving advice on recognizing and preventing the flu.
The typical Estonian autumn-winter season of coughs, colds, and sore throats has begun, mainly caused by various viruses that result in acute upper respiratory tract infections.
"The most common causative agents are rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus."
The general term for these diseases is acute respiratory viral infections, and specific symptoms such as cough, sore throat, runny nose, or headache are treated in their case," says Triinu-Mari Ots.
An exception is the flu virus, the course of which is very specific and can be determined based on symptoms already in the first days of illness.
"In that case, tests are also taken to provide laboratory confirmation of the presence of the flu virus," says the family doctor.
This is important both for determining treatment and for preventing or limiting disease outbreaks, for example in a work collective, gym, or school.
"HALF MOON": What books to read during the autumnal coronavirus crisis
Does spending more time at home bring about an increase in reading?
It is difficult to say whether quantity is actually that important in the end.
What can we find in bookstores?
Of course, biographies and cookbooks are leading the charts, but fortunately there are other options as well.
Journalist Andres Raid and legal scholar and clergyman Igor Gräzin talk about books around us and within reach.
Reverse green turn or simply stupidity cubed: toilets and trash cans disappear from the side of state roads.
Another example of saving on the wrong side comes from the Transport Department, which goes against the widely implemented green thinking.
As the transport authority needs to cut operating costs by over 3.5 million euros next year, one saving measure found was the removal of toilets and trash bins from parking lots.
The decision was made based on the fact that traffic safety suffers the least when cutting these costs, explained Raido Randmaa, the director of the Infrastructure Management Service of the Transport Administration, to ERR.
There are 61 toilets belonging to the Transport Department in parking lots all over Estonia, and there are 63 garbage containers in parking lots.
Toilets cost the office 472,000 euros per year, and trash cans cost 267,000 euros.
According to Randmaa, the decision has already been made in the transport department, but since the budget of the department has not been finally confirmed yet, there is no signature on this decision.
"Well, heaven help us - as the former CEO of Circle K and currently the CEO of Ragn-Sells, I cannot stay silent," comments top executive Kai Realo on social media about this decision.
"When Circle K wanted to build service stations along the new highways, where, as you know, there would be both trash cans and toilets, the biggest challenge was to find locations where the former Road Administration would have granted proper entrances and exits because 'Estonia is so small that a person can drive from one end of the country to the other in one go, and they don't even need to refuel, eat, or use the restroom along the way'."
Realo adds that such an attitude silenced back then, but the current decision is downright insane: "Can you imagine this 'land of peeing men' and those garbage heaps by the forest edge?"
Latin American prostitutes and illegal immigrants also take advantage of Estonia's "openness".
"Avatus" has turned Estonia into a magnet for representatives of the shadow side.
BNS reports: On Wednesday, the police deported a woman from Brazil who was working as a prostitute in the capital city.
According to the North Prefecture of the Police and Border Guard Board, the visa-free stay of a 29-year-old Brazilian woman in Estonia was terminated prematurely on Wednesday, November 24th, as she was providing sexual services in Tallinn for money.
The woman was issued an order to leave Estonia and a one-year entry ban to the Schengen territory was imposed.
This is not the first time.
The police deported a woman with Colombian citizenship who worked as a prostitute in Estonia this July.
The Northern Prefecture conducted an illegal procedure against a Colombian citizen woman born in 1988, who arrived in Estonia with the intention of providing intimate services.
A woman was issued an order to leave the country and she was given a three-year entry ban.
In December 2019, the portal Uued Uudised wrote: "The police deported a Brazilian citizen who worked as a prostitute in Tallinn."
On Thursday, an employee of the North Border Guard and Migration Supervision Office conducted an illegal procedure against a Brazilian citizen born in 1998, as reported by the North Prefecture.
The man did not wish to cooperate with the police officers and in addition, he had provided sexual services in Tallinn for money.
The man's travel goal did not correspond to the actual goal.
"The police terminated the man's visa-free stay prematurely, issued an order for him to leave Estonia, and imposed a three-year entry ban."
Latin Americans have also been found in Estonia, having arrived here through other paths.
This August, Delfi Ärileht wrote: "On the evening of August 4th, a car with Estonian registration plates, a Toyota Yaris, driven by a Brazilian citizen born in 1993, was checked in Tallinn."
The woman turned out to be an undocumented food courier who will be deported from Estonia.
In the vehicle, there was a courier company's food bag, and from the woman's phone, it was visible that she had fulfilled the last order less than 10 minutes ago.
The person's short-term employment at the PPA was not registered.
The woman's visa was declared invalid and her visa-free stay in Estonia was shortened once.
The woman was issued an order to leave Estonia within 15 days and was given a ban on entry for 3 months.
Twenty-seven migrants who died in the English Channel were immediately thrown into the propaganda mill.
The death of twenty-seven migrants in the autumnal English Channel is undoubtedly a great tragedy, but the liberal West immediately incorporated it into their propaganda, largely to justify their inaction.
The most hypocritical move was made by France, whose president Emmanuel Macron warned British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday against exploiting the migration crisis for political purposes, referring to a boat accident in the English Channel that claimed the lives of 27 people.
Before that, however, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed in a phone conversation on Wednesday to intensify action against deadly sea crossings.
"Both leaders were explicit that today's tragic loss of life served as a stark reminder of the importance of keeping all options on the table to prevent these lethal sea crossings and disrupt the business model of the criminal gangs behind them," said the spokesperson for the British government.
The United Kingdom is a country where these people strive to go, and France is a transit country where they all rush through unhindered and live in tent camps while waiting for human traffickers - Paris should have all the means to prevent migrants from using it as a jumping-off point, not to mention blocking the English Channel for human trafficking.
The British don't want them, neither do the French - so what are the obstacles to closing the migration route?
In connection with the sinking of a migrant boat in the English Channel on Wednesday, which claimed the lives of at least 27 people, five individuals have been arrested, announced French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin on Thursday.
According to the prosecutor of Lille, on Wednesday, 17 men, seven women, and three minors died in a boat that sank near the northern coast of France.
Four suspects in human trafficking were already arrested on Wednesday afternoon, clarified Darmanin.
French authorities did not hold back their words to express their alleged indignation, while human traffickers would not be able to operate without state support - and this support comes from both the maintenance of the Ma Manche migration route (which could be closed) and the creation of a favorable environment for human trafficking through allowing mass migration as a national policy.
President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday evening that France will not allow the English Channel to become a "graveyard" and promised that the authorities will find those responsible for this tragedy.
French prosecutors have initiated a murder investigation.
The President does not consider himself guilty, although it is during his rule that France has been flooded with migrants.
French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin called for a "tough international response."
He said that four people, who are suspected to be directly involved in the incident, have been arrested.
"He added that the criminal nature of these smugglers organizing these crossings cannot be condemned enough."
"This catastrophe in the strait is a tragedy," tweeted Prime Minister Jean Castex.
"My thoughts are with the lost and the victims who fell prey to those criminals who exploit their misery and suffering."
The hypocritical speeches of the French authorities will not prevent human trafficking and drowning deaths.
Among the cars with the highest mileage, German elite brands are leading.
Odometer rollback is one of the most common scams in the used car market.
This increases the price of a used vehicle that has been obtained through unfair methods and damages the value of the car.
A recent carVertical study revealed that buyers of German luxury brands are at the highest risk of purchasing a car with tampered odometer readings.
TOP 10 models with the most frequently rolled back mileage: BMW M5 is in first place on the list.
To determine the list of cars with the highest mileage rollback, IT company carVertical analyzed the history reports of over 700,000 used cars created between November 2020 and November 2021.
18 different markets were studied, including Poland, Romania, Hungary, France, Slovenia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Serbia, Germany, Croatia, Russia, United States, and Italy.
The mileage data shows that the BMW M5 is the car with the most altered odometer reading; over a third of used vehicles were associated with possible fraud.
This separate statistical indicator does not reflect the extent of the problem of BMW odometer rollback - as CarVertical's automotive expert Matas Buzelis recently noted, the entire list is dominated by various models of BMW.
"Half of the TOP 10 list is occupied by cars from this manufacturer."
The indicator is correlated with the demand for used BMWs in different markets.
It also appears from the data that more expensive cars are more likely to have altered mileage readings, and this fact should be taken into account when searching for a used vehicle.
Here the car mileage check comes in handy.
In the ranking of cars with rolled-back mileage, the second and third places are occupied by BMW 7 Series and Subaru Outback with 33.4% and 31.8% respectively.
The Audi A8 was the fifth most frequent car involved in mileage fraud, while its sportier sibling, the A7, achieved the tenth place, with slightly over a quarter (25.8 percent) of such vehicles having artificially reduced mileage according to the study.
Matas Buzelis explains that the more frequent representation of higher-class vehicles in the list of vehicles with altered odometer readings is primarily due to the greater potential profit margin in the sale of such used cars.
Odometer rollback is a relatively cheap and simple method that gives dishonest car sellers the opportunity to earn extra money.
You will find the longer list of the 20 most frequently returned mileage cars from the entire study.
Most frequently tampered mileage models by production year: the risk of fraud is higher with older cars.
Studies show that when buying a used car, it is important to check the mileage of the car, especially in the case of older vehicles.
The most popular models with altered odometer readings were produced between 2006 and 2016.
Car expert Matas Buzelis emphasizes that there is a connection between the possibility of fraud and the price range of the car.
"The list of cars with the most frequently rolled back mileage mainly consists of elite-class vehicles, but there are also models of popular cars, although their share is smaller compared to the total number of rolled back mileage cars."
Subaru, Ford, and Volkswagen cars belong to the same age group as higher-class vehicles.
It seems that the mileage of cars aged 5-15 years is most likely rolled back.
Agricultural Chamber: production cannot be sacrificed for the green transition.
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce believes that in order to achieve climate neutrality, efforts must be made by both entrepreneurs, consumers, and the state. However, achieving green transition goals cannot be done through reducing local production and the number of animals.
The changes associated with the green transition must also be economically feasible for companies, which requires effort from entrepreneurs, consumers, and the government together.
The Agricultural Chamber considers it important that there is an understanding of the combined impact of the climate package and the EU Green Deal strategies on Estonian agriculture and food production before making decisions.
To obtain an overview of the real environmental impact of the Estonian agricultural sector, a comprehensive assessment based on location and management method is needed.
Similarly, achieving the goals of the green transition cannot happen through reducing local production and the number of animals.
The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce supports the direction taken by the European Commission to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, although it will be a major challenge for our agriculture, food industry, forestry, and rural sector.
However, every challenge also brings opportunities that must be skillfully utilized, as stated in the opinion sent by the Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce to the Ministry of the Environment regarding the European Commission's climate package "Target 55", reports BNS.
The Agricultural Chamber of Commerce, which was led by its leader Roomet Sõrmus last year as the initiator of the import of Ukrainians, is trying to stand out both for the green turn and for farmers - at the same time, the desires of farmers and climate hysterics are so different that it is difficult to reconcile them.
In addition, farmers' future is haunted by various ideological associations and pressure groups, such as animal and environmental activists, vegans, and others, whose activities are aimed at restricting and ending animal farming.
Migration pressure is increasing: Finnish entrepreneurs in Estonia are also complaining and threatened with a tax increase.
It is sad and funny that the Reform Party has chosen Finns as the spokesperson for their immigration plans, who complain that there is a shortage of workforce in Estonia, while Estonians are working in neighboring countries - they should bring Estonians back home to work in Finnish companies here.
However, the media blares about labor shortage every day, which is probably a new propaganda campaign to get people used to immigration.
According to BNS, at the meeting of the Finnish-Estonian Chamber of Commerce held on Tuesday, foreign companies operating in Estonia identified the biggest drawback of the Estonian business environment as a shortage of workforce.
"Estonian and Finnish companies have a common problem, where in a country with an aging population, there is an increasing shortage of skilled labor," said Minister of Entrepreneurship and Information Technology Andres Sutt, according to a press release from the meeting.
"At the same time, we see recruiting skilled workers from abroad and ensuring tax compliance as a short-term solution to solve the growing skilled labor crisis, which is a shared value with us," he added.
Andres Sutt could pay closer attention towards Finland - they are solving labor force problems with the help of Somali and other Moorish "skilled workers" - and express whether the Reform Party also sees a way out in them.
The minister does not want to address the topic that behind the statement "Estonian and Finnish companies have a common problem" are also Estonians who emigrated during the previous government of the Reform Party.
This story is accompanied by a threat: "According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (MKM), there will be approximately 31,000 fewer working-age people in Estonia in five years, and an alternative to increasing the state's revenue base would be raising taxes."
In other words, it is being scared that if one does not agree with strangers, taxes will increase and pension will not be received.
However, it is forgotten that foreign workers drive down the wages of Estonian people.
Meanwhile, such threats had subsided, but just a few years ago, it was written about how there would be a shortage of tens of thousands of workers in construction, agriculture, and elsewhere in 2040 - as if there would be no technological development in 20 years and everyone would still be doing manual labor in that aforementioned year.
Paul Oja: the dark future visions in Tom Clancy's action novels also spoke of a pandemic.
In the 1960s, Soviet science fiction literature began to gradually break free from the dense thicket of purely technical details or the struggle against petty sabotage.
On one hand, bright visions of a happy communist future for humanity were being constructed (Ivan Yefremov's "Andromeda Nebula" in 1957, Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's "Noon" in 1962), while on the other hand, dystopias depicting future wars, acts of terrorism, or pandemics created under the decaying capitalism of the West were condemned.
Mostly people would sigh and say: "In the year 2000...!"
What is and what is to come... As we know, Soviet communism disappeared along with its bright visions of the future into the black hole of history even before that magical year.
Sharp-eyed Western writers continue to provide food for thought with their works.
Tom Clancy, a skillful and prolific writer of techno-thrillers or technical action literature, kept a keen eye on world events.
In 1975, a Soviet missile carrier attempted to escape from the port of Riga to Sweden but was forced to stop 50 miles before reaching Swedish territorial waters.
In 1984, Clancy's thriller "The Hunt for Red October" was published, which could have been inspired by this event and became a global bestseller.
"The Invisible Enemy" (Patriot Games, 1987) is about the activities of the Irish Republican Army.
"The Cardinal of the Kremlin" (1988) sheds light on the arms race between the USA and the Soviet Union in space against the backdrop of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, with a subplot focusing on the Soviet Union's hopelessly stalled war in Afghanistan.
"Reaalne hädaoht" (Clear and Present Danger, 1989) describes the war against drug lords in the forests of Colombia and the cabinets of Washington, "Kõigi hirmude summa" (The Sum of All Fears, 1991) explores what would happen if Middle Eastern terrorists were to acquire a nuclear weapon.
Gradually, however, the relationship between Tom Clancy and the material he was dealing with began to change.
Careful monitoring of global trends made it possible to predict certain pivotal events - unfortunately, in the form of dark scenarios that, sadly, had a tendency to turn from thrilling stories into reality.
In the novel "Debt of Honor" at the end, a terrorist crashes a large passenger plane into the White House just as a Congressional session with the President in attendance is taking place.
The novel was published in 1994; we know well what happened on September 9, 2001.
Not all of Clancy's painted threatening visions have come true.
The great war described in the 2000 novel "The Bear and the Dragon" between China and Russia did not happen.

In the novel "Executive Orders" from 1996, an attack is carried out against the USA using a bacterial weapon, attempting to achieve the collapse of the country through an epidemic.
Thanks to general vaccination, the epidemic is quickly extinguished.
In the novel, it is much easier to come up with a truly effective vaccine than in reality.
In the novel Rainbow Six, 1998, the danger is much more serious.
A top-level scientist, at the same time the leader of one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, has gathered around him a group of like-minded individuals who have decided to eliminate a significant portion of the world's population during the pandemic in order to save the planet from the catastrophic consequences of human activity.
A guaranteed lethal virus is being developed based on Ebola.
At the same time, two vaccines are being developed.
Vaccine A really provides protection against the disease.
This is injected before the start of spreading the virus to like-minded individuals and otherwise trustworthy or necessary people.
Vaccine B, however, is intended to be released to the market shortly after the outbreak of the pandemic.
He seems to provide some protection, but in reality, it is intended to further spread the disease in order to definitely achieve the initial goals.
The virus is planned to be spread through the air humidification system at the stadium of the Olympic Games held in hot weather in Australia.
Brave fighters against terrorism from the Rainbow group manage to catch the former KGB officer with the help of a last-minute intervention. Humanity is saved from the evil plague, and life continues as before.

Step towards sustainability: SEAT connects the factories in Spain and Portugal with a railway line to reduce CO2 emissions.
Spanish car manufacturer SEAT has set a goal to become a carbon-neutral company by 2050.
To achieve this, SEAT launched the environmental program "Move to Zerø" to reduce CO2 emissions throughout the life cycle of products, services, and mobility solutions.
Now SEAT intends to take another step forward in the "Move to Zerø" strategy by establishing a new railway service that connects the Martorell (Spain) factory with the Volkswagen Autoeuropa factory in Palmela (Portugal).
Until now, vehicles produced in Martorell were transported by train to Salobral (Madrid) and then delivered by truck to various dealerships.
With the new line, vehicles will reach the Palmela factory directly, from where they will be transported by truck to the Azambuja distribution depot, located 75 kilometers away, for the last time.
Currently, the service is operating twice a week and is expected to transport over 20,000 vehicles per year.
Thanks to this, 2400 truck trips are avoided annually and CO2 emissions are reduced by as much as 43%.
The new train service, operated by Pecovasa Renfe Mercancías, consists of 16 wagons.
Its maximum length is 500 meters and allows for the transportation of up to 184 vehicles per trip.
From 2023, a train with 18 carriages will be put into use, which can transport nearly 200 vehicles at once.
By 2024, hybrid locomotives will start moving on the tracks, allowing for 100% use of electricity on the route.
European Medicines Agency's green light: Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine is suitable for children aged 5-11.
The European Medicines Agency recommended on Thursday to expand the authorization of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine Comirnaty for children aged 5-11.
Until now, the vaccine was allowed for 12-year-olds and older.
The Pfizer coronavirus vaccine dose intended for children aged 5-11 is three times smaller than the regular dose (10 µg compared to 30 µg).
Just like in older age groups, children are also given a vaccine course in two doses with a three-week interval.
A clinical study conducted with 2000 children showed that 5-11-year-olds had three times smaller immune responses with the same dosage as older age groups with a full dose.
The side effects were similar to those in the older age group and they were mild or moderate and resolved within a few days.
Therefore, the European Medicines Agency concluded that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the associated risks in children aged 5-11.
The authority now sends a recommendation to the European Commission, who will make the final decision regarding the use of the vaccine.
Marje Oona, a member of the National Immunoprophylaxis Expert Committee, told ERR that the committee will likely make a decision on this matter next week.
"Since the approval of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) exists, we know that the approval of the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already been in place for some time."
The American Immunization Committee has already given this recommendation quite some time ago, and over three million children have already been vaccinated in the United States, so I actually don't see a very good reason why it wouldn't be given.
"But we haven't discussed it yet," commented Dr. Oona.
