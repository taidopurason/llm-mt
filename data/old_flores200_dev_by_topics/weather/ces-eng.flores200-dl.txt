A tornado is a rotating column of air with very low pressure that sucks inward and upward the surrounding air.
They cause very strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, which then move with the tornado.
They start as funnels that are launched from storm clouds and become "tornadoes" on contact with the ground.
